Tests were performed and I went from the ERto a speedy admission with sepsis.My situation became more grim when further testing revealed the bacteria had begun to attack my heart, which doctors suspected since I have a graft in my aorta and an artificial valve.?After constant iv antibiotics and a dozen moretests, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel. However, the tunnel as it's been explained to me stretches into January, 2021. I'm hospitalized for eight weeks.?I'm not able to return to work until that time and I'm simply unable to make ends meet without any income. With a very promising prognosis, I'm glad to say this situation is temporary and I should be back in the saddle (aka the teacher's desk in my classroom!) in time for the spring semester.I know a lot of you reading this are furloughed,jobless, suffering crippling underemployment or worse... And I don't expect any apologies or explanations from anyone who can't possibly help me... Honestly, this is a very last resort and,if you've read this far you're likely someone in my life that loves me and that's enough -- I hope I can repay you in some fashion once I'm out of the hospital and back helping my kids acquire their second (or third or fourth) language.?Feel free to call / text / messenger / FaceTime or reach out any way you can. I'm at National Taiwan University Hospital Hsinchu Branch ward 4A room 10D. I've got about 6 or 7 weeks left.?Any help can bestow is simply going to my monthly expenses and any expenses I'll incur here in hospital.

5,Save Nil's Life!,"Created March 10, 2020","Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,400,000 ","$2,402,960 ",12.8K,16.8K,12.9K,"Save Nil?ôs Life ! I am starting a campaign for Nil G√ºle√ß who is the daughter of my close friends Ali and Nihan G√ºle√ß. Nil was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2. In order to have a? better future, Nil has to receive a genetic therapy called Zolgensma. Zolgensma costs $ 2.1 million, with additional expenses the total amount reaches $ 2.4 million. Zolgensma approval only covers children under 2 years. Nil is 18 months old. We have a fight against the clock. She must receive her treatment in the United States. Below, you can find the story of Nil and her family. Your donations will be greatly appreciated. This campaign is dedicated exclusively to Nil.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------When you find out you're going to be a mom, everything changes. From that moment on, your life will be completely different, and you start worrying about being able to ensure a good life, a good academic education, the best environment and a more comfortable and safe route throughout your life. And you do it with an unconditional love and you are excited to think about the precious and unique moments to enjoy with your baby.You give birth to your baby and the doctor leaves it in your shaking hands. It is the best feeling in the world. The first contact between you makes you a natural teacher to handle everything that scared you before for lack of experience. You start feeling more secure. And the more you share something with your baby, the more you enjoy being a mother. You already have the answer instinctively of all the questions that you had when you were pregnant. And now is the time to grow together with your baby, cry together, laugh together ...But at one point, even if you have no idea what is happening, something happens and time starts to run in the wrong direction. And that moment all your future plans are shattered, motherhood already has another dimension and your sweet dreams are replaced by a tremendous concern. Because your daughter is diagnosed with a rare disease: Spinal Muscular AtrophyAt first you don't want to believe it. Your heart is broken You blame yourself because you have brought it into the world. Your baby is innocent. On the one hand, you die of regret, your soul hurts, you have the words drowned in your throat but on the other hand the doctors keep telling you that your daughter has to start her treatment immediately. Because every moment, a motor neuron dies.Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease, which is manifested by a progressive loss of muscle strength that affects the ability to walk, swallow and breathe. And it is the first genetic cause of infant mortality. It is caused by a mutation in the survival gene of motor neurons 1 (SMN1). This gene is responsible for the production of a protein that is critical for the nerves that control our muscles. Without this protein, these neurons cannot function properly and die at any given time.Our daughter Nil is 18 months old. And there is a genetic therapy called ""Zolgensma"" approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children under 2 years old with a price of 2.15 million dollars. Zolgensma is designed to replace the missing or defective SMN1 gene with a functional copy that produces the SMN protein, thereby improving the function and survival of motor neurons. It seems that Zolgensma can save lives of those who are lucky enough to get it with a single dose treatment.Today Nil can't stand or walk. Unfortunately, we don't have a second to lose. We imagine her walking, running, playing with her friends and we want her to be part of society, feel proud of herself and have a long life.We, as her parents, without knowing that we are carriers of this disease, are broken, it is hard for us to breathe, say something or think ... We need the support of volunteers who can help us during this fight and donate motor neurons for our little daughter. We hope that Nil is one of the lucky patients receiving this treatment.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ƒ∞ki √ßok yakƒ±n arkada?ƒ±m Ali ve Nihan G√ºle√ß?ôin kƒ±zƒ± Nil G√ºle√ß i√ßin bir ba?ƒ±? kampanyasƒ± ba?latƒ±yorum.

Y lo haces con un amor incondicional y te ilusiona pensar en los momentos preciosos e √∫nicos para disfrutar con tu beb√©. Das a luz a tu beb√© y el m√©dico lo deja en tus manos temblorosas. Es el mejor sentimiento del mundo. El primer contacto entre vosotros te convierte en una maestra natural para manejar todo que te asustaba antes por falta de experiencia. Empiezas a sentirte m√°s segura. Y cuanto m√°s compartes algo con tu beb√©, m√°s disfrutas de ser madre. Ya tienes la respuesta instintivamente de todas las preguntas que te com√≠an la cabeza cuando estabas embarazada. Y ahora es el momento de crecer junto con tu beb√©, llorar juntos, re√≠r juntos... ??Pero en un momento dado, aunque no tengas ni idea de lo que est√° pasando, pasa algo y el tiempo empieza a correr a una direcci√≥n equivocada. Y ese momento todos tus planes futuros est√°n destrozados, la maternidad ya tiene otra dimensi√≥n y tus sue√±os dulces est√°n sustituidos por una preocupaci√≥n tremenda. Porque le diagnostican a tu hija con una enfermedad rara: La Atrof√≠a Muscular Espinal ?Al principio no quieres cre√©rtelo. Se te rompe el coraz√≥n. Te culpas a ti misma porque t√∫ lo has tra√≠do al mundo. Tu beb√© es inocente. Por un lado, te mueres de arrepentimiento, te duele el alma, se te quedan las palabras ahogadas en la garganta pero por otro lado los m√©dicos siguen dici√©ndote que tu hija tiene que comenzar su tratamiento inmediatamente. Porque cada momento, muere una neurona motora. ?La Atrof√≠a Muscular Espinal (SMA por su sigla en ingl√©s) es una enfermedad neuromuscular, que se manifiesta por una p√©rdida progresiva de la fuerza muscular que afecta la capacidad de caminar, tragar y respirar. Y es la primera causa gen√©tica de mortalidad infantil. Es causada por una mutaci√≥n en el gen de supervivencia de las neuronas motoras 1 (SMN1). Este gen es responsable de la producci√≥n de una prote√≠na que es cr√≠tica para los nervios que controlan nuestros m√∫sculos.

Parece que Zolgensma puede salvar vidas de aquellos que tienen la suerte de obtenerlo con un tratamiento de √∫nica dosis.??? Hoy Nil no puede ponerse de pie o caminar.

Me la imagino caminando, corriendo, jugando con sus amigos y quiero que forme parte de la sociedad, se sienta orgullosa de s√≠ misma y tenga una vida larga.

6,A Better Life for Livie,"Created May 8, 2020","Medical, Illness & Healing","??,000,000","??,040,870",31K,30.9K,31K,"We are raising funds for the treatment and care of Olivia, our beautiful baby girl. Little Livie has been diagnosed with a rare and serious genetic neuromuscular condition called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1.? SMA is caused by a gene deletion which results in deterioration of Livie?ôs nerve cells connecting her brain and spinal cord to her body?ôs muscles. There is no cure and Livie has its most severe type. Livie?ôs muscles used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up, moving her head, and even swallowing and breathing, are becoming progressively weaker and shrinking. Without any treatment, little Livie?ôs condition would continue to deteriorate and it would be unlikely that she would live past her 2nd birthday. Every child with SMA is different and little Livie?ôs future is very uncertain. Treatment options for little Livie are very limited.? Our best hope for a better life for Livie is a once-off gene therapy called Zolgensma, which is currently only available in USA. It costs approximately US$2,100,000. Studies have shown that Zolgensma can substantially improve quality of life. Livie's antibody test qualifies her for the treatment. We are against the clock as Zolgensma is only available to children under the age of two years. Little Livie?ôs StoryLittle Livie was born on the 26th August 2019. We have never felt a love like this. It was incredible for us to see our first child smile, laugh and babble for the first time and watch her develop her little bright, affectionate and loving personality. Livie brings such joy and happiness to our lives every day and her smile can brighten the whole room even on the rainiest Irish day.We grew concerned as Livie missed some of her development milestones. We contacted her GP and were eventually referred to Crumlin Children?ôs Hospital. Our world changed forever on 9th April when little Livie was diagnosed with SMA type 1. This condition affects approximately one in every 10,000 babies. It had already been such a hard time for our family with the COVID-19 lockdown. Due to hospital policy on social distancing, Karen (Livie?ôs mum) was alone when given the diagnosis and Keith (Livie?ôs dad) was alone when he heard the diagnosis over the phone. It is something that will stay with us and our family for the rest of our lives. We were left devastated and one of the hardest parts of this process is being isolated without support from our family and friends during this difficult time.SMA does not affect Livie?ôs cognitive ability. She remains a bright, alert and bubbly little girl, curious about everything she sees and desperate to experience life. Livie?ôs smile and laugh are infectious. She loves engaging with people and wants to be in the thick of every conversation around her. Normal infections and illnesses such as a chest infection can be very serious for Livie, possibly life-threatening. The current COVID-19 pandemic is so worryingly dangerous for Livie. Karen will be Livie?ôs full time carer as Livie needs support all day and every day. Her days and weeks are busy with medical appointments and check-ups.Livie has received her first dose of another treatment called Spinraza through a lumbar puncture in Ireland. We remain hopeful that Spinraza will prolong Livie?ôs life and allow Livie to gain a degree of head control and sit with extra support. We have been advised that Livie will still need respiratory and feeding intervention to survive. She is already struggling with her breathing and coughing. She needs to wear an oxygen mask every night. This is very uncomfortable for Livie and she struggles to sleep with it. It is very unlikely that Livie will ever stand or walk.We are fundraising for Zolgensma because we could never afford to pay for this treatment by ourselves. Our dream for Livie is to give her the best chance at life possible. Zolgensma is our best hope to do this. If we are unable to raise enough funds to pay for little Livie?ôs treatment, we will put all donations towards Livie?ôs care with the hope of giving her the most comfortable and happy life possible.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately the bad kind. These days 90% of Leukaemia patients are cured.? I?ôm in the 10%. Intense chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant (from my twin brother Justin) and other treatments have all failed to kill the cancer. I?ôve been told I?ôve just a few months to live. I was also told a year ago my Leukaemia was ?úincurable?? That was until a few weeks ago. A specialist team in Singapore have a brand new treatment. It cured Oscar, a 5 year old boy in the UK (you can read about Oscar here?).?? And I?ôve just been told I?ôm eligible for the same treatment. But the treatment is in Singapore. And it costs ¬£500,000.? It sounds huge. How are we going to raise that?? But as my mum and dad say, ?úwe just need 50,000 people to give ¬£10 and we?ôre there?¶or just 5,000 to give ¬£100!?ù¬?That?ôs it.?? Please give me my chance. To beat this cancer and live. That?ôs my plea. But it?ôs not my story.? My story is below.? Please read it. So you get to know me. And thank you for reading this. I can?ôt tell you how amazing it is that ordinary people want to reach out and help someone in need. Thank You.AlviarMy StoryWhen I was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2017 at 15, I was sure I would be part of the 90% of patients that stay in remission after treatment. Unfortunately, that hasn?ôt been the case. I'm in the 10% and I have been fighting this cancer tirelessly. Over the last 3 years, I?ôve been through several rounds of intense chemotherapy, 2 courses of radiotherapy, and a bone marrow transplant (from my twin brother Justin). All with the amazing support of the NHS world-renowned cancer team at UCLH in London. ?However, this summer I received the horrible news that the disease is once again progressing. In January my doctors told me we had run out of options and that I had limited time left. We reached out to specialists from all over the world. The brightest leukemia experts came back with one response.? My time was very limited. Just a few months. I don?ôt want to go into the feelings my brain went through when I heard this. And when I saw my mum?ôs and dad?ôs faces. And my brothers. We were all terrified.? Now, 8 months later I?ôm still here. But my doctors remain blunt. When the cancer starts to break through again and the chemo stops working I may have only a few weeks to live. We don?ôt know when this will be, but I am running out of time.One of the great new breakthroughs in cancer care in recent years has been CAR-T treatment where they modify the T-cells (one type of defence cell) to attack the disease. But I have T-cell leukaemia and they?ôve not been able to safely get T cells to attack diseased T-cells. Until now. One team in Singapore has managed to do it and has already cured a 5 year old boy from the UK(you can read about Oscar here? ).?? I now have a chance to go and get the same treatment. A chance to have a normal life as a teenager, cancer-free: a chance to really start my journey. I feel like cancer has robbed me of the last 3 years. I won?ôt let it take any more.But the treatment alone costs ¬£500,000 and it has to be paid up front. We need to raise this urgently. If we don?ôt raise it in a matter of weeks, the bad Leukaemia cells could break through again and my chance would be gone. It?ôs hard for me to write this, but without this treatment I?ôve been told I won?ôt make it. The hospital require the ¬£500K to be transferred to them before the treatment can start. So all the 500K raised will be transferred to the Singapore hospital. ?We?ôve set out at the end of the page what the hospital will use the money for and what will happen to any unused (or any extra) raised. We hope to use them for any other treatment or expenses during treatment, and if any is left over I want to donate to another person needing the same treatment. I?ôd love to be able to help someone else in the way I?ôve been helped. Like an ordinary teenager, I like meeting my friends. Like playing video games and going out. I love to read fantasy novels by Terry Pratchett. ?At home I enjoy spending time with my mum, dad, two brothers, and cat. This year I turned 18 and was accepted into my dream course to study biomedical sciences at Oxford. I?ôll be studying to help fight diseases. Perhaps to help give others a chance for a miracle cure. I never thought I?ôd achieve this dream.? Just an ordinary kid from a state school. ?But studying is one of the things which kept me going through all the horrible treatment. These past few years I have worked so hard (even studying from hospital!) to make it this far. I don?ôt want all the effort to have been for nothing. Throughout my treatment I have been adamant that I will not give up: not on my treatment, not on my studies. This is still my mindset: this will not be the end of me, and this is just the beginning of my journey!?

Please read them as it means a lot to me!______________________________________________Mum's Story?Hello everybody, I?ôm Alviar?ôs mum, Chiharu. Thank you so much for reading Alviar?ôs story and thinking about a donation towards helping us to go to Singapore to receive treatment.?3 years. Young people like Alviar feel this much longer than people my age. 15 to 18 years old should be the most wonderful years in life. You would think Alviar must have had a very hard and sad 3 years and the same for us as a family. Of course that?ôs true, it?ôs been really hard on all of us. But actually we have a lot of happy memories looking back these 3 years. Alviar is surrounded by very supportive friends who don?ôt mention his illness so he can just be a normal teenager like everybody else.? ?I want to tell an episode that so impressed me. When Alviar had his first relapse, he started to lose sight in his left eye and then his right eye as well. It was a scary moment because his eyesight was getting worse every hour and finally he had to stop reading because he couldn?ôt see the words. We were admitted to the ward in UCLH and that night Alviar got a message from one of his friends using some new social media voice messaging technology. Young people are amazing, finding new ways to communicate to Alviar and send him messages to tell him he?ôs not alone. ?He was so happy. That was so special. ?Alviar?ôs teachers at the local comprehensive, Roundwood Park School, were wonderful, always offering a lot of ideas,not just to keep Alviar studying, but for his mental support and for that of his twin brother Justin and older brother, Bryan.?I want to say some thank yous.?We have so many wonderful people in the NHS supporting us. The doctors and nurses at UCLH are always welcoming us with big smiles on our day care visits and when staying in the ward at the hospital: always cheerful and making sure that Alviar can have his treatment comfortably. The doctors are always ready to show us the next possible treatment every time he relapses. Watford community nurses are a great team: they always think of what?ôs best for Alviar. He didn?ôt want to miss school so they always put his visit in the early morning for blood check ups and treatments and they always care about not just Alviar?ôs body condition but his happiness as well. ?I also want to mention some charities that have been there for us. The ladies from CLIC Sargent, Rennie Grove and Keech always make me feel happy after I talk with them, I feel secure because they know what?ôs happened and what is going to come next and they're much more than supporters, they're my friends.??Our family! In the UK, Switzerland, Japan, the US and Australia are always asking us how we are doing. My husband?ôs aunt and uncle have been always thinking about us, their minds are strong and they raise my spirits every time when we have bad news. My sister and brother in law are amazing, always by our side with big strong positive minds. ?Our Friends! It wouldn?ôt be enough even if I can say thank you so much 1000?ôs of times to my friends and family.? If I wasn?ôt with them, I couldn?ôt cope these3 years. I want to be strong in front of my sons and my husband (even when I sometimes cry), but I don?ôt need to be a strong person with them. I can share all of the good news and bad news together. I always feel I?ôm not alone. I can?ôt tell all episodes because it?ôll be too long. ?But one episode that made our treatment more cheerful was the dinner parcels. When Alviar had his second radiotherapy, it was 3 weeks of treatment for which we had to visit UCLH every day. Our village friends made a team to prepare the evening meals every single night during this difficult time. Every night when we got home, hot meals and desserts were waiting for us. It was such a happy time for us even during the tough treatment, Alviar and I always talked about what?ôs today?ôs dinner would be and we all put on weight!?Sometimes, I get emotional and I wish if I could pull all of my son?ôs leukemia cells into my body because I?ôve lived enough and everybody can just forget me. Even if I didn?ôt exist anymore nobody should be sad and he can just have a normal life. Also I forget what a normal life would be. But looking back these 3 years, my mind has been always happy surrounded by warm-mindedpeople and now our doctor has found this opportunity to cure Alviar! This journey will be the last one and Alviar will be cancer free! ______________________________________________Dad's StoryAugust 2017, almost 3 years to the day that I?ôm writing this plea. We are packing our things to go on a holiday to Malta. We usually spend our holidays camping and hiking in the British countryside. We don?ôt do island beach holidays, but this year we?ôve hired a cottage for a week and are planning on doing some of the things we?ôve never done before. Like scuba diving in the beautiful blue seas we?ôve seen on the tourist sites. Maybe we?ôll even hire a sailing dinghy for a day and mess about in complete incompetence in the warm shallow waters. All 3 kids are full-blown teenagers now and they won?ôt want to be doing this sort of thing with their crabby parents for much longer. The day before we fly Alviar throws up his breakfast again. He got food poisoning at a dodgy restaurant he went to with friends to celebrate the end of school a good few weeks ago. It doesn?ôt seem to be going away. My wife Chiharu decides to take him to the doctors to get some medicine we can take away with us so that we don?ôt spoil the holiday. The doctor decides to send us to the local hospital for blood tests. The blood tests show that his kidney function is suffering, we should go to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London for more tests. They?ôll arrange an ambulance. I ask if we should consider not flying tomorrow. ?úI would?? says the doctor. I begin to get very angry with the restaurant. I tell the doctor we could drive him to GOSH, it?ôs only 30 minutes up the motorway to London. ?úNo, no, we?ôll go under blue lights so it will be much quicker; better you go home and get him a few things and meet them there at the hospital.?ù¬†GOSH is amazing. How many people have written that sentence? I?ôm upstairs at the renal centre and it?ôs so beautiful. It seems to send out auras of competence and professionalism at the same time that it has a friendly ?òkiddiness??to it. They?ôve prepared a whole room for Alviar. It?ôs huge and it has a playstation and videos all wrapped in a cute bear cupboard. I browse through all of the games and videos in the hour and a half I have before they arrive under those super-quick blue lights. Intensive care is something else. The nurses flit constantly around the open-plan beds under the lights that never go off, while the dialysis machine whirs as it flicks Alviar?ôs blood around what looks like an enclosed pinball machine, ?òdirty??blood out and ?òclean??blood in. It?ôs our companion for the next 2 weeks, until Alviar?ôs finally given the all-clear and we, my wonderful family and friends and colleagues all breathe a massive sigh of relief. They?ôre still not sure what caused the problem, most likely the food poisoning, as we suspected. I consider writing an angry letter to the restaurant, or maybe I?ôll write directly to the Food Standards Agency.?Three weeks later, we?ôre back with the cute teddy bear playstation and the pinball machine. I?ôm now commuting from the hospital: I work in Westminster and it?ôs rather a pleasant commute in the summer sunshine. The beer and pizza in the pub around the corner from Gosh are even more pleasant. My wife isn?ôt there to scold me and Alviar?ôs happy for me to slip off for an hour or so to get my dinner. He?ôs tucked up with his GCSE textbooks as usual anyway: the playstation has barely left its cupboard. Alviar calls. The doctor thinks I should come back to have a word. ?úWhat, now???My pizza hasn?ôt arrived yet and I?ôve only just started my second beer. ?úNow. And you?ôd better call Mum and ask her to come to the hospital too,??he says. Shit. I get my pizza rushed into a box and down my beer. The doctor can?ôt wait until my wife arrives. ?úIt?ôs not food poisoning.??he says, ?úIt?ôs Leukaemia.??All I can think of is that I?ôm really glad I didn?ôt send that letter to the restaurant. ?And so it begins. We?ôre moved from GOSH to the Teenage Cancer ward at UCLH. The rooms are even bigger and they still have playstations. No cute teddy bear cupboards though. That and the MacMillan Cancer Centre round the corner are second homes to us now. We know everyone, everyone knows us. They know Alviar and his textbooks, always with his textbooks, through the intensive chemo and the radiotherapy and the lumber punctures and the transfusions. The textbooks are always on his lap, weighing down the blankets. They?ôre great at sending him home as much as possible, so he can go to school. When he can?ôt the school are great in letting him Skype into lessons, even though they?ôre not really sure it?ôs allowed. There?ôs a break in the treatment to allow him to take his GCSE exams. He gets the top grade in 9 out of 10 subjects and the 2nd top grade in the other. Of course he does. He?ôs a studying machine that seems to never stop pumping, just like the pinball machine at Gosh. My wife starts trying to match him in studying. She?ôs stuck to the computer every night past midnight reading academic papers on leukaemia research. Our consultant almost sighs at every meeting as another wad of research is thrust into her lap, but she doesn?ôt sigh: she?ôs far too professional and far too understanding for that. ?It?ôs all going so well. He?ôs off the intensive treatment and onto the long-term maintenance. They can cure 90% of kids with leukaemia these days. Just 50-60 years ago all those kids would be dead. They?ôre still looking for and finding new ways to chip away at that last 10%. You don?ôt think about the last 10%. Even when the maintenance starts and a few weeks later Alviar starts to lose sight in his left eye, you don?ôt think about the last 10%. It?ôs his first relapse, it?ôs okay, they have a plan. Plan B swings into action like an army that?ôs been waiting to rush over the border. We have a whole new team to get us transplant-ready. Medical teams across the world are sent his blood profile. We need a bone-marrow match and they?ôre asking in Germany, America, Japan even though his brothers have a 25% chance of matching. His twin Justin is non-identical so he has the same 25%, but he?ôs a bull?ôs-eye. We?ôre back on the rails. Alviar?ôs bone marrow will become Justin?ôs bone marrow and Justin?ôs bone marrow doesn?ôt produce leukaemia. Simple! Only it isn?ôt of course. For Justin it?ôs a breeze, Alviar not so much. Through all of the intensive chemo, the steroids, whatever they?ôve thrown at him over the last 18 months he?ôs barely broken a sweat: the textbooks have remained firmly propped up on blankets and the studying machine has rolled on, cramming more and more knowledge into that sponge. Now however for the first time I watch the textbooks slide off the blankets, unwanted and even unloved. Now I know he?ôs really ill and I?ôm scared.?But Justin?ôs cells graft. They start producing Justin blood in Alviar, and Alviar?ôs back home, back at school and powering his way to his A-level exams. He begins to think about Oxford. It?ôs a dream, but with the work he puts in, surely he has the right to that dream? We have another 10 months or so living the dream and then Alviar and I are in the local hospital again. His vision has started to deteriorate in his left eye. They do all sorts of eye tests as if something is wrong with his eye, but Alviar and I smile ruefully. We know there?ôs nothing wrong with his eye. It?ôs the leukaemia, and it?ôs back in his central nervous system. It?ôs back to UCLH and this time they?ôre blunt. This is your second relapse. We have no more armies waiting to rush over the hill. You?ôre in the 10% mate. Sorry. ?That?ôs how blunt it felt, but they don?ôt give up. They put him on maintenance and keep the leukaemia at bay. They don?ôt know how long they can do it for, but it?ôs long enough to get him through his Oxford interview and his mock exams. You know how those went of course. The pinball machine is still pumping those balls with pinpoint accuracy. I start to hope for such little things. Let him get to his exams. Let him get to university and go to some wild parties. Let him get to the point where they find the next big breakthrough. Like I said they?ôre still looking for ways to chip away at that 10%. There?ôs CAR-T treatment where they modify the T cells that help fight disease so that they?ôre targeted at the leukaemia. Only Alviar has T-cell leukaemia and you can?ôt modify the bad cells to attack themselves. Until now. That?ôs why I?ôm writing this and why I?ôm so grateful to you for reading this far. There?ôs a team in Singapore who have done it. They?ôve managed to get T cells to attack diseased T cells. It could be the breakthrough that brings us to 9%, 7%, 5%. We don?ôt know, but in 1962 they were curing about 3% of kids with leukaemia. 97% of the kids who got what Alviar has got died. In 2020, only 60 years later 90% of those kids are getting cured. How many kids are we talking about? It doesn?ôt sound much when you say that about 45 kids per million people get leukaemia. But there are now 7,800 million people on the planet (up from only 2,500 million in 1951, wow) and that means 350,000 kids every year are getting it. That means 700,000 parents like us are going through all of this. Every year. The unlucky 10% is 35,000 who don?ôt make it. Saving an extra 5% could mean saving an extra 17,500 children every year. ?So if this new treatment can help bring down those numbers, it will not just allow Alviar to go to university (yep, he got the grades and his place is waiting for him), it will mean that in the next 50 years we have a chance to get closer and closer to that 5%. This treatment costs ¬£500k. Half a million pounds. We have to pay that up-front before the treatment can begin. So we?ôre here asking for help. Only it?ôs not a lot of people really, we need 50,000 people to give ¬£10. There?ôs 7.8 billion on the planet and we don?ôt need ¬£7.8 billion pounds! We just need 50,000 people to give ¬£10. Or 5,000 generous people to give ¬£100 With the world connected the way it is today we can do this. If you?ôre going to give us ¬£10 and you ask all of your friends on Facebook and SnapChat and all of the other platforms to do the same and some of them do it, we?ôll get there in no time. Alviar is my son. He?ôs a great kid.? But any kid deserves this chance. ?Thank you so much for caring and being here and reading this.? Please share and let?ôs make this happen.______________________________________________What will the money raised be used forThe initial goal is GB¬£500K.? That?ôs the money the Singapore hospital need us to transfer before they can accept me for the treatment.? The hospital have said as follows: ?úThe costs quoted are estimated costs including most common complications expected. They will include:-? ? ? ?Initial chemotherapy to attempt another remission of disease-? ? ? ?Leucopheresis? (harvesting) the T-cells from Alviar-? ? ? ?Chemotherapy if needed until the CAR-T cells are ready-? ? ? ?Admission for CAR-T conditioning and infusion-? ? ? ?Stay in Hospital until recovery and complications post CAR-T-? ? ? ?Bone marrow transplant from matched unrelated donor or family donorUnused funds will be returned after completion of therapy. ?úIf we raise funds over the 500K or if for any reason the hospital returns any unused funds to us, then we will use these as follows:1) Payment for any other treatment or care for me2) Payment for travel to / from Singapore and other necessary expenses for me and my family in Singapore during my treatment there3) Any excess we will gift to a family / person needing to fund similar treatment. We would love to have extra and be able to gift to help another child or person in the way we?ôve been helped. We know the stress families go through when told of the costs and we hope we can give someone else a big boost. 4) If after a reasonable period of time we have not located what we feel is a suitable donor for any excess funds, (re point 3) above, then we would gift the money to a registered cancer charity. ?Thank you again for your support. It means the world.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,Life for Robert,"Created December 8, 2019","Medical, Illness & Healing","$500,984 ","$501,541 ",16.6K,37.9K,16.8K,"This is the most heartbreaking letter that a mother can ever write, but here I am telling you the story of my baby boy Robert. Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert (citeste scrisoarea in romana mai jos)I carried my baby boy for 9 months, waiting him to come in our lives and meet his older sister Emily. Robert was born on October 1st. When I first held him in my arms I knew what it was like to feel fulfilled. 4 years after giving birth to our little girl Emilia, God has blessed us with a little boy. I brought Robert home and our family was complete.One month after, at a doctor's check up, we were told that we should do a genetic test for something called ""spinal atrophy."" I knew that the biggest fear a parent can ever have is about to come true. Even though he didn't give us details, not to frighten us, with a simple Google search, we found: ""The number 1 genetic disease that kills most babies up to 2 years old.""I continued to read and I felt it in my bones that this was the disease that was affecting my child. I refused to believe, but I knew it was true. We did 3 genetic tests in different laboratories to be sure. Until we got the result, I was hoping that maybe it is something else, any other disease would be easier to treat than SMA Type 1, that is a death sentence.When I received the first result, I was devastated. I cannot describe what was in our soul. Emptiness... and all I felt was injustice ... and no, not injustice for us, but for him! All the abilities that all of us take for granted, like breathing, talking or walking, for Robert means a huge struggle.?I felt injustice and concern for his future, especially in a society that does not make room for people with special needs. This disease is so rare that only 5 years ago scientists could find a way to stop it. Before that, children born with SMA Type 1 had no hope, their parents just had to see how each day their baby could move less until their last breath. ?They were bedridden, breathing and eating with the help of machines.SMA is a terminal muscle degenerative disease,?affecting eating, talking, moving and even breathing. It results in muscle wasting where infants often die of respiratory failure or suffocation???ãbefore reaching the age of two.?With SMA Type 1 it's a race against time because each day means a loss of specialized nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and muscle cell death.There is no cure for SMA, but there is a treatment in the United States that stops the disease. As a gene therapy, ZOLGENSMA ?replaces the function of the missing or non-functioning SMN1 gene with a new functional copy of an SMN gene. Families that received the treatment ?say that this medicine was a miracle and some patients that received it early, even had complete rehabilitation and they can walk. It seems extremely unfair to think that life could have a price. But yes, his only chance is this vaccine that can stop the illness ?and costs $ 2.1 million. It is a huge amount, we never thought we would need to call for help, but this challenge is greater than we could have ever imagined.Due to the degenerative nature of the disease, we are racing against time and appealing to family, friends, local and global community to raise funds for Robert's gene therapy. As parents, we feel powerless because we can't afford to buy him this cure. I don?ôt know why life gives us such challenges, but I look into Robert's eyes and I know he came here for a reason. We would work as much as needed in order to gather this sum, but unfortunately there is a clock ticking and each day that passes, our son can loose some of his abilities and they can never be restored. No child deserves to suffer, all children deserve to live and make this world a better place!Please help us make his story known by sharing to your family, friends, and the world. Every dollar gets us closer to saving his life.?______________________________________________________________________________Este cea mai indurerata scrisoare pe care o mama o poate scrie vreodata, dar aici sunt, impartasind povestea bebelusului meu Robert.Mi-am purtat baietelul in pantec timp de 9 luni, asteptand sa vina pe lume si sa isi cunoasca surioara mai mare. Robert s-a nascut pe 1 octombrie la Chisinau. Cand l-am tinut pentru prima data in brate am stiut cum este sa te simti implinit. Dupa 4 ani de la nasterea fetitei noastre Emilia, Dumnezeu ne-a binecuvantat cu un baietel. L-am adus acasa pe Robert, iar fericirea noastra era nemarginita. La o luna de la nastere, la un control la doctor, ni s-a spus ca ar trebui sa dam o analiza genetica pentru ceva numit ?úamiotrofie spinala?? Am stiut ca cea mai mare temere pe care un parinte poate sa o aiba vreodata se poate adeveri. Chiar daca nu a vrut sa ne dea detalii ca sa nu ne sperie, la un search pe Google, am gasit: ?úBoala genetica numarul 1 care omoara cei mai multi bebelusi pana la 2 ani?? Continuam sa citesc si simteam pana in maduva oaselor ca asta e boala care imi fura copilul, am refuzat sa cred, dar stiam ca e adevarat. Am facut 3 teste genetice in diferite laboratoare pentru a ne convinge. Pana sa primim rezultatul, aveam speranta ca poate este altceva, orice alta veste ar fi fost mai usor de tratat decat acest diagnostic crunt.Cand am primit primul rezultat, am facut cunostinta cu durerea nemarginita. Singurul lucru pe care il simteam era Nedreptate??si nu, nu nedreptate pentru noi, ci pentru el! Toti pasii pe care noi ii primim cu o normalitate debordanta, pentru ei inseamna lupta.?Robert trebuie sa lupte ca sa respire, ca sa manance, ca sa miste fiecare parte a corpului. Am simtit nedreptate si ingrijorare pentru viitorul lui, mai ales intr-o societate care nu face loc si persoanelor cu nevoi speciale. Acum 5 ani, nicaieri in lume nu exista tratament pentru aceasta boala. Copiii erau tintuiti la pat, ei respirau si mancau datorita aparatelor. Acum exista o speranta pentru Robert. Amiotrofia spinala afecteaza neuronii din maduva spinarii, adesea si pe cei din trunchiul cerebral, ducand la moartea acestora. Forma de Amiotrofie spinala 1 este cea mai severa din punct de vedere al evolutiei si progresului, aproximativ dou? treimi dintre to?i copiii cu SMA tip 1 mor de stop respirator √Ænainte de v√¢rsta de trei ani.Pare strigator la Cer sa te gandesti ca viata ar putea avea un pret, dar da, unica lui sansa este acest vaccin poate opri boala copilului nostru si costa 2.100.000 $. Nu ne-am gandit vreodata ca va fi nevoie sa apelam la ajutor, dar aceasta greutate este mai mare decat ne-am fi putut imagina.Nu exista nici un remediu, dar exista un tratament in Statele Unite care opreste boala. Ca terapie genica, ZOLGENSMA este proiectata sa vizeze cauza radacinii genetice a atrofiei musculare spinale (SMA) prin inlocuirea functiei genei SMN1 disparute sau care nu functioneaza cu o noua copie functionala a unei gene SMN.2 milioane de euro este o suma enorma, nu stim daca exista vreo sansa ca sa se stranga acesti bani, dar stim ca puterea oamenilor este mare, iar noi nu vrem sa renuntam sa credem. Nu stiu de ce viata ne da astfel de incercari, dar ma uit in ochii lui Robert si stiu ca a venit sa faca minuni. Aceasta suma sperie, dar optimismul meu de mama vrea sa creada ca daca 2 milioane de oameni ar da cate 1 euro, Robert ar putea avea o sansa la viata. Nici un copil nu merita sa sufere, toti copiii merita sa traiasca si sa faca din lumea asta un loc mai bun!______________________________________________________________________________–≠?–æ ?–∞–º–æ–µ –¥??–µ?–∞–∑–¥–∏?–∞??–µ–µ –ø–∏??–º–æ, –∫–æ?–æ?–æ–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –±?

Nothing. Panic. I cannot speak. No words can ever explain what my son Kiran has gone through or could express his sorrow, his pain, his fear during all these months. Watching my 16 year old boy listening to what the doctors had to say the other day was unimaginable, unbearable. Hearing from his medical team that there are no more chances, no future. ?Kiran was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of Leukaemia (T-ALL) in January 2020.? Despite having lots of treatment for over 9 months here in the UK, including a bone marrow transplant from his 9-year old sister Asha, on Friday 6th November he was told by his doctors that the cancer has come back, even more aggressively this time, and there is now nothing else they can do for him. We are all devastated. He just wanted to get better and go back to school. On Monday 9th November he was offered a compassionate place to try a new treatment being developed in Singapore (you can read about it here and watch here?). The treatment is very expensive. ¬£500,000. Only three children have had the treatment before. It has been successful for all three, and another is about to start treatment. We are doing all we can to raise the money but we need to raise it fast as Kiran is running out of time. They want to start the treatment in early December. Please could you donate whatever you feel you can to give Kiran a chance. This in turn will help the doctors to learn and help other children who may have this cancer in the future.? You can read Kiran's story below. I have written my feelings down too and Kiran's dad is writing a blog which you can follow here?. Please. Help Kiran have a future. Thank? you.Cristina (Kiran's mum)Should you wish to help with this fundraising effort or have any queries please email: achanceforkiran@ gmail.comKiran's storyHi, my name is Kiran and I am 16 years old. I am the second of 4 children and I live in London, although I grew up in Barcelona, where most of my relatives are. I love playing videogames, playing basketball and volleyball, spending time in nature, playing the piano and guitar, travelling and trying all kinds of exotic food.I was diagnosed with leukaemia (T-ALL) back in January 2020, when I was only 15 and it has been a very difficult journey since then. At first the side effects of the treatment were bearable so I tried to keep on going to school and studying for my exams but soon we all realised our life had changed dramatically and everything was no longer like it used to be. I couldn?ôt meet my friends, I couldn?ôt go to school, I couldn?ôt practice any of my favourite sports and, something that really upset me, I was not able to fly back home and go fishing in Mallorca or walk in the fields of La Segarra.The intense treatment I have been receiving over the last 9 months (including a bone marrow transplant from my youngest sister Asha on the 4th of September) has caused a lot of side effects and I have become much weaker and vulnerable. I have gone through lots of complications and some of my organs have been damaged but there has always been a relatively good and speedy recovery. I have been doing my best to recover from every step, physically and emotionally, but unfortunately the relapse of my cancer wasn?ôt something that was in our hands. Last Wednesday I noticed my eye twitching and I knew something was going wrong: the leukaemia had come back, only two months after my bone marrow transplant.On Friday 6th November the doctors said that we had run out of options in the UK, and told us about some new therapy trials which are taking place in the National University Hospital in Singapore (NUS). It is one of only 3 hospitals in the world where the revolutionary CAR T-Cell therapy is being used to treat T-ALL (please see my dad?ôs explanation on this in his blog above) and I have been offered the opportunity of this very new treatment. I am very anxious as it is a very innovative treatment and only 3 patients have tried it so far. We are still not sure about long term side effects. But, even if it doesn?ôt go well, I am still optimistic because I know I will be contributing to science and hopefully this treatment will help cure other patients with T-ALL in the future.Please help me receive the opportunity to stay alive and fulfil my future and my hopes and dreams. First, I would like to go back to my ordinary teenage life, to carry on with my A Levels, to go back to my volleyball, to travel back home to Mallorca and Montoliu, to study Computer Science at Uni, but also to simply enjoy life along with my beloved ones; my 3 sisters, my mum and dad and all my relatives and friends. My dream is to become a game developer and enjoy my adult life fully. Please help me to get there. Help me have a future. Kiran?Cristina's storyI cannot speak. No words can ever explain what my son Kiran has gone through or could express his sorrow, his pain, his fear during all these months. Watching my 16 year old boy listening to what the doctors had to say the other day was unimaginable, unbearable. Hearing from his medical team that there are no more chances, no future. And then there is us: three sisters, a dad, a mum. A beautiful family of 6, united and full of collective and individual dreams and plans.And then there is Silence. Nothing. Panic. Kiran is the sweetest person I have ever known. He is kind and peaceful; since he was a child Kiran has always wanted to avoid any conflict and just live his life smoothly, often trying to pass unnoticed in all kind of situations. He is serene and reserved, always avoiding doing any harm to anyone. He is truly respectful; not just a polite child with good manners, but deeply respectful of all the living beings that surround him. I have never heard a judging word from him. Life for him seems to mean Nature in balance, and that is all.My son has always found happiness in the simplest of things; it comes naturally to him. He is genuinely happy to lie silently on the sofa, looking up at the ceiling, just thinking. ?He is the least spoiled child I have ever met, and he has never been interested in owning things ??with the exception of his Play Station!But all such cosmological balance is suddenly broken, and it seems that life is no longer being as kind to Kiran as he has always been with Life; he keeps thanking us for giving him such a happy childhood.I love my boy. I love how he is. And I think life and the world would be a better one if he can stay longer. Much longer.Please, please, please, help us in trying to keep Kiran with us. I don?ôt want to let him go. Cristina PS I forgot to say how brave, courageous and strong my boy has become from this experience. He has been a constant inspiration and we have learned from him every single day.Note:?The deposit required to start the treatment is ¬£280,000, with an overall cost of ¬£500,000 including a bone marrow transplant.If the donated funds exceed the final hospital charges, or in the eventuality that the treatment cannot take place, the family will donate to cancer research on your behalf.Thank you.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although she still has many months of treatment ahead, we hope and pray that Fiadh will be cancer free following her treatment under the amazing care of her oncology team in Crumlin.??The major worry for us and for Fiadh's doctors is the rare and aggressive nature of her disease, because there is a high risk of disease relapse. Unfortunately if this happens, Fiadh?ôs chances of survival are very low.??The drug trial in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre, New York, may increase Fiadh?ôs chances of survival as it directly targets any remaining cancer cells in Fiadh's body. This treatment is not available in Ireland and because it?ôs still a trial, there is no funding available to get Fiadh there.Our girl Fiadh loves dancing in the kitchen to Ed Sheeran's Galway Girl, eating her favourite ice cream, climbing anything she can and playing with her baby brother P√°id√≠. She has already been through so much in her short life and we are all so proud of her - please join Future For Fiadh and help her kick cancer?ôs ass for good. Any help you can give us here would be greatly appreciated. Please donate and share our campaign with family, friends and colleagues.For more information visit: https://www.futureforfiadh.com/DiagnosisOn the week before Christmas 2019, at one and a half years old, we noticed that Fiadh's tummy looked a little swollen and she seemed a little out of sorts.?Fiadh seemed otherwise well, so Laura booked an appointment with our GP for a check-up. Even in the waiting room, Fiadh looked like the happiest and healthiest child there, climbing on the chairs and saying hi to everyone. Little did we know how much our world was about to change.?Little Fiadh was referred to Wexford General Hospital for scans, where they found a large mass in her abdomen. She was transferred by ambulance to Crumlin Children?ôs Hospital in Dublin where she was diagnosed with a Stage 4 neuroblastoma tumour; a rare and aggressive childhood cancer.? This tumour was the size of a melon at 14cm long and had already spread to her bones, bone marrow, lungs and was pressing on her liver and bowel.?TreatmentImmediately, just 4 days before Christmas, little Fiadh started aggressive chemotherapy. Santa delivered a little play kitchen to St. John?ôs oncology ward in Crumlin on Christmas Eve, which she loved but was just too sick to play with initially.Neuroblastoma cancer is so rare; only 6 children in Ireland are diagnosed each year. From the beginning, we were told that her chances of survival were only 50:50 due to the aggressive nature of her cancer. Fiadh?ôs oncology doctors mapped out an aggressive treatment plan for Fiadh over an 18 month period. Despite this extensive treatment, relapse rates for this particular form of cancer are very high. The first treatment stage was to try to shrink the tumour through chemotherapy, so that it could be removed surgically.For us as Fiadh?ôs parents, our world has completely stopped. Our amazing little Fiadh went from being a healthy one and a half year old child with a sudden swelling in her tummy, to a child with one of the rarest and most aggressive childhood cancers. We immediately moved to Crumlin to be with Fiadh for the initial stages of treatment, leaving behind her 12 week old brother P√°id√≠ with his Nanas, Grandads and Aunties.?For many weeks, Fiadh stayed in hospital getting the most intensive treatment that her tiny body could handle. She was in immeasurable pain; she stopped moving, eating and talking for periods of time and was on daily medication.??Fiadh is a tough cookie and has fought through every difficult stage so far. She has made it through 50 days of chemotherapy, 3 different surgeries, two stem cell transplants, more than 30 blood and platelet transfusions, over 12 weeks of total isolation in Crumlin hospital, with only one adult allowed to be with her at a time. Fiadh has spent over 150 days in hospital since January and she missed her baby brother P√°id√≠ each time she was away. Fiadh?ôs grandad Jim was receiving palliative chemotherapy at the same time as Fiadh and they often spent days recuperating together. We are all so proud of Fiadh. She has taught us huge strength and courage through this heart-breaking time.How Fiadh is nowAt present, Fiadh is being fed through a tube as she has been every day since December. Fiadh needs 24 hour care and the coronavirus has made things even more difficult and complicated. She still has to go through 3 weeks of Radiotherapy with a general anaesthetic every day and then 6 months of Immunotherapy.?Fiadh has received excellent care from all the staff in Crumlin Hospital and St. Gabriel?ôs ward in Wexford. We will forever be grateful for the help, support and care they have shown to Fiadh and our family. Fiadh often amazed the nurses and doctors with her ability to climb and her mischievous and kind nature keeps us all smiling.Fiadh?ôs doctors, nurses and family hope that Fiadh will be cancer free once her immunotherapy finishes next year. However, the major concern with this disease is how aggressive it is and should she relapse, Fiadh?ôs chances of survival are very low.There is a cutting-edge cancer treatment aiming to decrease her chances of relapse currently on trial in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York. The treatment aims to target and kill any remaining cancer cells. The trial requires multiple trips to the hospital for tests and treatment over a two year period. As this drug is still in the trial stage, there is no available funding through her Health Insurance or the HSE.And so Fiadh, and all her family are asking for your help to raise the money required for this life saving treatment. We need to get rid of this cancer once and for all.?www.futureforfiadh.comRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nog geen jaar getrouwd en 7 maanden zwanger op dat moment. Ze is dezelfde dag met spoed opgenomen.De afgelopen maanden heeft ze zo ongelofelijk hard gevochten tegen deze vreselijk nare ziekte. Maanden lang slopende chemo?ôs en een bevalling (onder narcose). Het zag er goed uit, de kankercellen daalden, we waren hoopvol.Azra kreeg na de vele chemo?ôs een beenmergtransplantatie, zodat de kankercellen niet meer terug zouden komen. Haar zusje was hiervoor haar donor. We werden weer allemaal hoopvol, maar dit was van korte duur...Vlak na de transplantatie was Azra misselijk en kreeg buikklachten waardoor ze niks binnen kon houden. De artsen deden onderzoek, maar konden uiteindelijk niks vinden. Ze dachten dat het bijwerkingen waren van de vele chemo?ôs en transplantatie. Op 9 september 2020 ging ze voor controle naar het ziekenhuis, waarbij ze het vreselijke nieuws kreeg dat de bloedresultaten er slecht uitzagen en dat ze niks meer voor haar konden doen.?Azra zou nog een paar weken tot maanden te leven hebben! De artsen gaven aan dat er geen behandeling meer mogelijk was voor haar. Toch willen wij niet opgeven, Azra heeft nog te veel om voor te leven. Ze heeft sinds januari niet kunnen genieten van de laatste maanden van haar zwangerschap en nog belangrijker, van haar lieve kleine meid Sara.Op dit moment zijn alle mensen die Azra liefhebben alle mogelijke opties aan het onderzoeken voor een eventuele behandeling in het buitenland. Ze heeft als laatste wens om nog 1 keer naar Bosni√´ te gaan. Het land waar ze is geboren en waar ze als klein meisje samen met haar ouders is gevlucht voor een beter bestaan.?Met deze crowdfunding willen wij een bedrag verzamelen die we grotendeels aan een behandeling in het buitenland zullen besteden en haar reis naar Bosni√´. UPDATE: In gesprek met verschillende ziekenhuizen in het buitenland zijn we op de hoogte gebracht van een veelbelovende behandeling genaamd CAR-T cel therapie in Duitsland. Het moeilijke is nu dus dat de zorgverzekering deze behandeling alleen vergoedt voor kinderen en jongvolwassenen t/m 25 jaar. Azra is in maart 26 geworden en komt dus net niet in aanmerking wat betekent dat we deze kosten zelf moeten betalen. De behandeling zal naar schatting 300.000??kosten. Aangezien Azra volgens de? artsen nog maar een paar weken te leven heeft, is het noodzakelijk dat we dit bedrag zo snel mogelijk bij elkaar hebben.?ENGLISH:?HELP AZRA FIGHT LEUKEMIA?About 8 months ago our dear daughter, sister, friend, mother and wife was diagnosed with leukemia. As a newlywed and with a baby on the way, Azra was atmitted to the hospital.??The past few months she has fought this awful disease remarkably and proven to be a strong young woman. After months of chemo and the birth of a beautiful baby girl named Sara, things were looking good and we were hopeful.??Besides chemo, Azra also underwent a bone marrow transplant to prevent to the cancer cells from rising. Her little sister was the donor and again things were headed into the right direction.??Unfortunately, soon after the transplant she was feeling sick and experiencing severe abdominal discomfort. The doctors were not able to trace down the cause of the pain she was feeling. They thought it to be a side effect from the chemo.??On September 9th, Azra had an appointment at the hospital for a check-up. There, she received the gruesome news that her blood results were looking bad and that there was little they could do for her. They told her she had a few more weeks, months at the most to live.??Still, we will not give up this easy! There is a lot for Azra to live for. She hasn't had the opportunity to enjoy the last months of her pregnancy and more importantly, her baby girl Sara.??At this point, we, all the people that care about Azra and her family are exploring all possible options for a treatment abroad.?Azra also told us she would love to visit Bosnia, her birth country one last time.??With this crowdfunding we hope to collect a sufficient sum that will help Azra get the treatment she deserves.???UPDATE: While in consultation with hospitals abroad we have been informed about a promising and new treatment in Germany: the CAR-T cell therapy.?Our hurdle is however, that the health insurance only covers this treatment for young adults till the age of 25 and Azra just turned 26 in March.?If we want to get this treatment for her, we have to pay it ourselves. The treatment is estimated to cost 300.000?? According to the doctors she only has a few weeks. This means we have little time and it is imperative we collect this money rapidly.?Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

21,Rise Up for Rhys,"Created June 20, 2020","Medical, Illness & Healing","$500,000 ","$396,190 ",3.1K,2.3K,3.2K,"6 month old Rhys needs a life saving drug that costs $2.1 million. Follow Rhys?ôs story and current updates at www.RiseUpForRhys.org?and on Instagram @RiseUpForRhysIn May of 2019 while on vacation in Scotland, Rory and I found out we were pregnant (though I already knew - mother?ôs intuition kicks in early!)? Our baby girl was due on Christmas Day, and after a perfectly healthy pregnancy and 20 hours of labor, we welcomed her 3 weeks early on December 4, 2019 at 12:13pm. Even though I had sworn not to give my children confusing-to-pronounce Welsh names as my mother had done to me, we decided to name her Rhys (pronounced Reese). Overnight she made us a family, and even her fur brother Bruce was absolutely in love. (Jury is still out for Tony).Rhys had been a healthy baby, loving her baths, walks outside, and cuddles and kisses from her doggies. As Rhys approached 4 months, that mother?ôs intuition was nagging me - I noticed that she seemed to be falling behind on milestones other babies her age were hitting. She always struggled with tummy time, and wasn?ôt able to roll over or hold her head up for very long. At her 4 month check up, our pediatrician said she just had low muscle tone and recommended physical therapy. At her next check up at 6 months, the pediatrician immediately noted Rhys??lack of progression and expressed concerns that she may have Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a genetic condition we had never heard of before.?A quick Google search, confirmed every parent?ôs greatest fear: ""The number 1 genetic disease that kills most babies up to 2 years old."" Appointments with Geneticists and Pediatric Neuro-muscular Specialists were set, blood and saliva tests ordered, and the waiting began. We hoped it was something else less severe, easier to treat, less devastating. ANYTHING but SMA. After 2 weeks, the longest 2 weeks of our lives, we received the heartbreaking diagnosis - Rhys has SMA Type 1, the most severe form of the disease.SMA is a terminal muscle degenerative disease, affecting eating, speaking, moving and even breathing. It results in muscle wasting where infants often die of respiratory failure ?ãbefore reaching the age of two. With SMA Type 1, each day means loss of specialized nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and muscle cell death. It is so rare that just a few years ago, there was no treatment. Parents had to watch as their child was able to move less and less, becoming unable to eat and breath on their own.There is no cure for SMA, but in the last 2 years, two life changing treatments have become available. One treatment, SPINRAZA, works on the SMN2 gene, which is a less active copy of the SMN1 gene (the gene that is missing/non-functioning in a person with SMA). By boosting production of SMN2, SPINRAZA supports muscle development and provides a level of improvement. SPINRAZA is very expensive at $750K in the first year and $375K every year thereafter for life. In August of 2019, a new gene therapy, ZOLGENSMA was approved by the FDA. It replaces the missing/non-functioning SMN1 gene with a new functional copy. This medicine provides life changing improvement, some patients are even able to walk independently. Such a miracle drug comes at a cost, and ZOLGENSMA is the most expensive drug in the world at $2.1 million USD. Because SMA Type 1 is aggressive and degenerative, this is a race against time. With each day that passes, motor neurons in Rhys??sweet little body are becoming inactive. All funds raised will go to Rhys?ôs medical care including gene therapy (out-of-pocket responsibility outside of insurance not known at this time), physical and occupational therapy, mobility and development equipment, etc. She has a lifetime ahead of her and will need continuous treatment for the best chance at a full life. In the case there are additional funds beyond Rhys?ôs needs, they will go to Cure SMA, an organization dedicated to raising awareness for this devastating disease.?Every child should have the best possible chance at life - please join us to surround our happy little girl in love and support.

We are regular folks in Seattle and King County who have been active in various organizing campaigns, mutual aid work, and more importantly, in community with each other.? This is a result of love for the community. We are a collective of volunteers, not a non-profit. That means no overhead, every dollar is going towards groceries, supplies, and direct support.? ??Like us on Facebook!?Follow us on Instagram!?Spanish Version below - Version en espa√±ol abajo -?Our love for each other is greater than capitalism?ôs lack of effective planning. In Seattle, we have created a COVID19 Mutual Aid group, which aims to organize material support. Immediately we are providing grocery and supply deliveries. We are preparing to expand this to running errands, dog walking, childcare, caregiving, and mental/emotional support among people impacted by the pandemic. We are acting alongside those globally to show that our communities take care of each other and we also take care of ourselves. We can?ôt allow greed to guide our actions. We need healing love and compassion for one another.Let?ôs be clear, this is solidarity, not charity. In the absence of larger structural changes, such efforts will not be nearly enough and could burn out the people involved. So we are also supporting workplace organizing efforts, demanding paid time off, quarantine pay, etc. We know that undocumented communities will be one of the most exposed groups with the least government support. Undocumented workers frequently experience abuse by their employers and may not report their needs for fear of reprisals. We will prioritize those most vulnerable, those who are undocumented, disabled, elderly, houseless, BIPOC, queer and trans, sex workers, and communities displaced by gentrification. And we are also putting pressure on the system at large, calling for widespread free testing for COVID19, moratoriums on deportations, sweeps, evictions, and new bookings into jails and prisons. We demand closure of the NW Detention Center, that property developers with empty apartments give free housing until the crisis is over, and REAL resource redistribution from large corporations. The direct mutual aid caring work involved in these efforts requires material resources, and those must be provided immediately by Amazon, Microsoft and other large corporations who have made the city prone to such a crisis. We are here because of years of austerity, and Big Tech regressive taxes. The housing crisis and systematic divestment of the state from the essential functions of service and housing, is a product of neoliberal, austerity measures. Big Tech and capitalism drove that. We don't need charity from them. We need big tech to payback. They should be transferring many, many millions, if not billions of dollars into such efforts so that neighborhood care stations can be set up with testing, food, and emotional support, so that houseless people can access housing immediately, and people can practice social distancing without losing their jobs or becoming houseless. Where will the money from COVID-19 Survival Fund for the People go? We are currently funding up to $50 (per request) for grocery / supply home deliveries per household.??We will be directly giving financial support (via Venmo, CashApp, and Cash) to Undocumented, LGBTQI, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, Elderly, and Disabled, folxs who are bearing the brunt of this social crisis and self-organizing.? ?The financial support we are providing is for our most vulnerable communities to use as an emergency fund as they are the most impacted during the Covid19 pandemic.? We are chose to deliver the funds via Venmo, CashApp and Cash, because we want our communities to have the flexibility to use the emergency funds for what they believe is most important to them.??Seattle Request forms:English (English): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rOkXW6ElVT0MH9oSI-TuW8L5szCt-ULbZhWebARRZNI/viewform?

Exigimos el cierre del Centro de Detenci√≥n del Noroeste, que los propietarios con apartamentos vac√≠os proporcionen viviendas gratuitas hasta que termine la crisis, y la redistribuci√≥n REAL de los recursos de las grandes corporaciones.El trabajo de cuidado directo de ayuda mutua en estos esfuerzos requiere recursos materiales, y Amazon, Microsoft y otras grandes corporaciones que han hecho que la ciudad sea propensa a tal crisis deben proporcionarlos inmediatamente. Estamos aqu√≠ por a√±os de austeridad e impuestos regresivos de Big Tech. La crisis de vivienda y la desinversi√≥n sistem√°tica del estado de las funciones esenciales, es producto de medidas de austeridad neoliberales. La Gran Tecnolog√≠a y el capitalismo impulsaron eso.

Everyday with her went on so fast when we realized she already turned 4 months. I then began to realize she was not able to hold her head nor turn sideways. She was breastfeeding normally and was gaining her usual weight. Some of our family members told this is normal and she will be be holding her head in few months. We believed and carried on dreaming of her bright future.Days passed on and she was now 5 months. Still she was not holding her head. Now we were worried,so visited our doctor. Our doctor examined and did some neurological exam, few blood tests and a brain scan. Everything was normal and we were told she might be having a benign hypotonia of infancy. Just a bit physiotherapy and nothing much to worry about: I still remember my doctor words. We were happy she was alright and began her physiotherapy. Now she was 6 months, still hypotonic. We knew something was not right and again visited our doctor. Now our doctor advised us to visit a senior neurologist and we did so. I still remember that day, the saddest day of our life, the day when our dreams were shattered. The neurologist after assessing our child and looking the prior reports immediately told us she might be a having a neuromuscular disease only to be confirmed by genetic disease and most probably our child might be having the severe form of the disease. That was the day when we first heard of this disease called SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY. Blood was drawn and sent for genetic testing and we returned with heavy hearts.I was very tensed and started looking after it in internet. I was told about it a bit by my neurologist. It is a progressive neuromuscular disease that gradual weakens the muscles of limbs,swallowing and breathing. You can imagine the outcome. My child can?ôt sit up nor walk stand, she will not be able to eat and drink and finally not able to breathe on her own. Without timely treatment most of infants with severe form of SMA will be on permanent ventilation within a year of life and rarely survive beyond two years. I was always praying to god that our reports will be negative but i was wrong. Finally got the reports that showed my daughter Siyona had type 1 SMA. My neurologist told me the prognosis and gene therapy was the only cure. Gene therapy drug called Zolgensma costs nearly 2.1 million usd and we are no longer in a position to afford. We need your support to afford my daughter's treatment. I wish to see her stand and run and fulfill her dream. Please donate for my daughter and fulfill her desire to live and achieve her dream. We believe Siyona is one of the luckiest to receive Zolgensma.UPDATE-Utilization of fund.What if?? Lastly what is the plan if target is not met? How will the raised funds be utilised?First of all, seeing the support of all wellwishers all around the globe, I don?ôt see anything why our target won?ôt be met. Siyona deserves life and there are so many prayers and efforts that can?ôt be unheard by the God.? We will achieve the target.? I am her father and I have seen her suffering everyday and if any mishap happens or funds couldn?ôt be raised, then the funds will be utilised only for the palliative care of Siyona. I am a Nepal based doctor and I have seen how difficult is there for a Nepali patient to fight SMA. The remaining funds will be utilised to raise a SMA foundation in Nepal that will work entirely for the upliftment of SMA patients in Nepal including their palliative care. We are already on this process and the legal formalities are delayed by covid. We will soon update the process.Questions:How you are related to your beneficiary?Hello again, I am Anish Kumar Shrestha and Siyona is my niece.Her father Dr Sandeep Shrestha is my father's sister's son.While donations are being done by the generous donors, I have to regularly withdraw the amount. I have attached my bank's account number and other information so that the money will be directly be deposited in my bank account.When the target amount reaches we will directly deposit that amount with Novartis's Avexis with together work of clinic of special children and parents.The drug needs to be purchased first and the remaining balance will be used? for medical treatment costs at the hospital.Incase if the target amount doesn't meet up the parents Nepal bank account will be directly deposited from my US bank account.The fund will be used for palliative care of Siyona plus a SMA foundation will be established that will work entirely for the upliftment of SMA patients in Nepal including their palliative care.?If you require further documents and information we shall provide that .Please contact Dr Sandeep and Aleena for any more required documents.Their facebook profile ids are:Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/groups/238340680767197/Siyona Shrestha?ôs father facebook id:https://www.facebook.com/sandeep.shrestha.520125Siyona Shrestha mother facebook id:https://www.facebook.com/aleena.gurung.7374Gofundme organizer facebook id :https://www.facebook.com/anish.k.shresthaSincerelyAnish Shrestha[email redacted]323926450Youtube Siyona video link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdMTsb0CKyQRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is hope: In order to have a relatively healthy future, Metehan must receive a one-time dose of a gene therapy called Zolgensma. As SMA is a rare disease, Novartis charges a huge fee to cover their R&D costs and make a profit: Zolgensma costs $2.1 million ??with additional expenses such as travel, accommodation and consultancy fees, the total amount of reaches ~$2.45 million (currently ~¬£1.9m). For Novartis to approve Zolgensma therapy, a child must not reach 2 years or 13kg ??as this negatively affects the effectiveness and the safety of the treatment. Metehan is currently 11 months old (as of September 2020), thus we have a fight against the clock. The family do not have the means to make up anywhere near the required amount in this time frame, thus they need our help.Please donate as much as you can ??even if it?ôs a fiver ??and give Metehan and his family the chance to give life a shot. Please also share with anyone you feel would be willing to help.Thank you!Below, you can find further information on Zolgensma, Metehan, and his parents.?For updates and to reach the father or mother directly:Instagram: @metehan_smajourneyEmail: tuncayfidan_ [at] hotmail.comExtra information for UK donors: The NHS offers a drug called Spinraza to SMA patients, which is an effective therapy in the short-term, however it is invasive and only a partial solution and the costs to the taxpayer builds up continuously (especially for type 1 SMA patients). For a new therapy like Zolgensma to be offered by the NHS, it is thoroughly reviewed by the NICE committee (https://www.nice.org.uk/). The meeting for Zolgensma is expected to be held in October 2020 and the report is expected to be published in March 2021. The implementation of the therapy is likely to be much later than that, which is going to be too late for Metehan. There are great developments in the field of rare disease genetics and prices are expected to drop significantly in 5-10 years??time but not soon enough for Metehan. (Note: the newly FDA approved Risdiplam is also not available via the NHS and will need to go through NICE similar to Zolgensma)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Further information:1- NHS page on SMA: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spinal-muscular-atrophy-sma/types/2- Zolgensma general information: https://smauk.org.uk/zolgensma3- Blog post on the long-term value of Zolgensma by an SMA patient: https://www.statnews.com/2019/05/31/spinal-muscular-atrophy-zolgensma-price-critics/---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: If you do not want to pay a tip to gofundme.com, then do not forget to change the drop box (see below photo) to ""Other"" and then the amount to ""0"".

Das macht Ines nicht im Auftrag dieser Kampagne sondern vollkommen privat. Damit stellt es keine Gegenleistung im steuerrechtlichen Sinne dar!!! Spendenbescheinigungen d√ºrfen von uns leider nicht ausgestellt werden, da es sich bei den finanziellen Hilfen aus steuerrechtlichen Gr√ºnden nicht um eine Spende handelt.!Da es schon zu Missverst√§ndnissen gekommen ist: es ist NUR Steffi als alleinige Beg√ºnstigte eingetragen, die Initiatoren / Team Ewald haben NICHTS mit dem Geld zu tun und der Abruf erfolgt direkt auf Steffi's Spendenkonto!!Und noch eine wichtige Information: wenn man ""jetzt spenden"" anklickt, erscheint ein Trinkgeldvorschlag f√ºr das Team von GoFundMe. Man hat die Option einen anderen Betrag, also auch KEIN Trinkgeld, einzugeben. Mit ""Organisatoren"" ist ausschlie?lich GoFundMe gemeint. Wir / Team Ewald bekommen nichts und wollen auch nicht einen Cent! Im Gegenteil, wir sind alle berufst√§tig und alle zweifache Mamas und verbringen (gern!) sehr viel Zeit mit der Organisation, dem Bedanken, dem Beantworten von Anfragen / guten W√ºnschen, der Arbeit auf Facebook und mit der Presse. Und wir sind alle auch privat f√ºr Steffi da. Und das tun wir alles auch wahnsinnig gern und es hilft uns auch dabei, die auch f√ºr uns unfassbar traurige Situation mitzutragen.Liebe Freunde, Bekannte und andere liebe Menschen, Mit dieser Kampagne wollen wir unsere Freunde, Familie Ewald aus der N√§he von L√ºbeck, unterst√ºtzen. Durch einen leider unglaublich schlimmen ""Sechser im Lotto in der Gen-Lotterie"", dem seltenen Li-Fraumeni-Syndrom sowie einem m√ºtterlicherseits vererbten Brustkrebs-Gen k√§mpf(t)en nun schon 4 von 5 Familienmitgliedern gegen den Krebs. Familie Ewald braucht ganz dringend Eure Hilfe! Und hier ihre ganze traurige Geschichte: Sowohl Steffi als auch Basti mussten sich jeweils aufgrund von Krebs viel zu fr√ºh von einem geliebten Elternteil verabschieden. 2014 fing dann der ganz b√∂se Albtraum an: bei Tochter Neele wurde ein b√∂sartiger Muskeltumor festgestellt. Nach einer harten und nebenwirkungsreichen Chemotherapie und Operation hofften alle das allerbeste.Im August 2017 ging dann der Albtraum weiter. Papa Basti war Notfallsanit√§ter bei den Johannitern sowie Gruppenf√ºhrer und Oberl√∂schmeister bei der Freiwilligen Feuerwehr Hamberge, bevor es ihm pl√∂tzlich ganz rapide richtig schlecht ging. Sofort wurde er auf die Intensivstation aufgenommen. Dort wurde die unheilbare Diagnose ""Metastasierter Lungenkrebs"" gestellt. Vor allem dank neuester Antik√∂rpertherapien konnte der Verlauf zun√§chst verz√∂gert werden. Nachdem nun bei zwei unmittelbaren Familienmitgliedern b√∂sartige Tumoren festgestellt worden waren, wurden die ?rzte hellh√∂rig und leiteten eine umfangreiche Testung ein. Hier kam der n√§chste Supergau: Bei Tochter Neele, Papa Basti und leider auch Sohn Jonas wurde das Li-Fraumeni-Syndrom festgestellt. Das ist ein Gendefekt, der daf√ºr sorgt, dass entartete Zellen nicht vom K√∂rper vernichtet werden sondern sich immer weiter vermehren, sodass das Krebsrisiko massiv erh√∂ht ist. In dieser schlimmen Zeit machte sich pl√∂tzlich und unverhofft ein f√ºnftes Familienmitglied auf den Weg - Tochter Lenja, die im August das Licht (und ja auch leider die Dunkelheit) der Welt erblickte. Bei ihr wurde als einziges Ewald-Kind das Li-Fraumeni-Syndrom zum Gl√ºck nicht festgestellt. Bei Neele und Jonas wurden aufgrund des Gendefekts regem√§?ige Vorsorgeuntersuchungen incl. Ganzk√∂rper-MRT etc. durchgef√ºhrt - in der Hoffnung neue Tumoren fr√ºhzeitig aufzusp√ºren und dann besser behandeln zu k√∂nnen. Im Februar 2019 aber passierte das Unfassbare: bei Jonas zeigte sich im Kopf-MRT ein ""bithalamisches Gliom"", das sich sp√§ter dann als ""Glioblastom"", also als sehr aggressiver Hirntumor, herausstellte. Ein massivst b√∂sartiges und an der Stelle leider komplett inoperables Mistvieh! Obwohl Jonas k√§mpfte wie ein L√∂we und alles M√∂gliche und Unm√∂gliche versucht wurde, ging er am 29.12.19 √ºber die Regenbogenbr√ºcke.? Auch Papa Basti ging nach ganz langem und schwerem Kampf am 2.3.20 √ºber die Regenbogenbr√ºcke zu seinem Sohn Joni. Nun sind beide f√ºr immer im Himmel wieder vereint. Joni und Basti werden unendlich von ihrer Familie, ihren Freunden und vielen anderen lieben Menschen vermisst werden, die die beiden niemals vergessen und sie immer in ihren Herzen behalten werden.Und als wenn das alles noch nicht schlimm genug w√§re, wurde im Februar 2020 auch bei Mama Steffi Brustkrebs entdeckt. Leider ist es auch bei Steffi kein leicht zu behandelnder Tumor und der Ausgang trotz tapfer durchgestandener aggressiver Chemotherapie und bereits erfolgter gro?er, umfangreicher Operation noch ungewiss. Wir hoffen das Beste!Nach ganz kurzer ""Verschnaufpause"" wurde auch dieser Albtraum am 18.10.20 noch getoppt. Nachdem Neele ja schon als kleines M√§dchen erfolgreich gegen ihren ersten Krebs angek√§mpft hatte, konnte sie morgens pl√∂tzlich ihren Arm nicht mehr bewegen. In einem Notfall-MRT in der Klinik zeigte sich ein murmelgro?es DIPG (diffuses intrinsisches Ponsgliom), ein b√∂sartiger und nicht operabler Tumor im Hirnstamm. Wir hoffen, dass sich Neele unter der palliativen Behandlung soweit stabilisiert, dass die Durchf√ºhrung von Reservetherapien m√∂glich wird. Wir w√ºnschen uns, dass Neele alle sinnvollen Therapieversuche unternehmen kann um noch etwas Lebensqualit√§t zur√ºckzubekommen und noch etwas Zeit mit ihrer Familie zu verbringen, auch wenn der Tumor nochmal deutlich aggressiver als der ihres Bruders zu sein scheint. Etablierte Verfahren, die eine wesentliche Verbesserung der Situation versprechen, gibt es nicht! Wir brauchen Strohhalme und das Ganze zeitnah! Und das soll nicht an nicht vorhandenen finanziellen Mitteln scheitern! Und hier kommt Ihr ins Spiel: wir alle zusammen k√∂nnen Steffi und ihre Familie unterst√ºtzen. Wir k√∂nnen ihr ihre Liebsten zwar nicht wiedergeben und sie und ihre auch Familie nicht wieder gesund machen. Aber wir k√∂nnen Neele alle sinnvollen Therapien erm√∂glichen und Steffi das Gef√ºhl geben, dass egal was passiert, Lenja gut versorgt sein ist.? Steffi hat eine wunderbare Familie, die sich ganz doll k√ºmmert. Ihre Schwester Melanie aus den USA ist schon vor der Brustkrebs-OP gekommen und hilft ihr wahnsinnig. Finanziell sieht es aufgrund der vielen unglaublich b√∂sen Schicksalsschl√§ge alles andere als rosig aus. Es fanden zwar schon einige Spendenaktionen wie z.B. das gro?e Fu?ballturnier in Hamberge statt, das Geld wurde aufgrund der durchgef√ºhrten zus√§tzlichen Therapien, Fahrtkosten, letzten Unternehmungen als ganze Familie etc. schon ben√∂tigt. Und diese riesige finanzielle Sorge K?NNEN WIR ALLE zusammen tats√§chlich kleiner machen. Wir bedanken uns ganz herzlich bei jedem f√ºr jede noch so kleine Unterst√ºtzung! Eure Ines, Melanie, Nadine, Susann und Andrea Impressum / wer wir sind / Team Ewald: Wir, Ines Bober & Andrea Hieke, sind seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt enge Freundinnen von Steffi Ewald. Und unsere S√∂hne sind seit kurz nach der Geburt mit Jonas befreundet gewesen. Uns ist die Familie Ewald unendlich wichtig und wir begleiten sie jetzt schon seit vielen Jahren auf ihrem unglaublich schweren Lebensweg.

A 3-month stay at $5,000 per day, along with approximately $55,000 for air ambulance transport to and from the facility, means she will require $515,000 to get state-of-the-art rehabilitation at Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado. This rehabilitation is critical to her future well-being and ultimately to her return to home. Chelsea?ôs family is praying for a generous outpouring of donations to facilitate paying for these extraordinary costs.Chelsea is a 29-year-old woman who miraculously survived catastrophic injuries sustained on April 15, 2020.? She was a pedestrian on the sidewalk in the City of Buffalo, NY when a police SUV responding to a 911 call, crashed into a car, lost control and struck her. She flew a great distance and suffered multiple fractures, including severe injuries to her spine and brain stem.? Chelsea is currently quadriplegic and ventilator dependent. ?She has miraculously regained cognitive function and has the same great personality. She engages with family and friends via FaceTime using facial expressions, eye motions and by mouthing words.?Chelsea is a joyful, selfless human being who leads a life of Discipleship. She is a teacher of English to speakers of other languages and loves refugees. She recently became a realtor with the ambition of finding decent housing for the immigrant/refugee community in Buffalo, NY.? Chelsea has done missionary work in 12 different countries around the world. Her love for Christ and passion for spreading His word is her main objective in life. Within the last year, Chelsea bought a house and started an educational ministry out of her home to help refugee children and their families. She also regularly held Bible study in her home hoping that others might also be empowered by the love of Christ.? Friends of Chelsea created a Facebook Group entitled ?úChelsea?ôs Army??which is now over 2,100 members strong.? Individuals from this group have been fervently praying for her over the past six very challenging weeks.?

36,Nixon's Hope for a Cure against Neuroblastoma,"Created January 2, 2020","Medical, Illness & Healing","$350,000 ","$345,507 ",10.7K,5.9K,10.7K,"In July 2017, Nixon was diagnosed with stage 4 High Risk neuroblastoma MYCN amplified. It was discovered that the cancer was throughout his entire abdomen (from his pelvis to his diaphragm), spots on his chest, right arm bone and both thigh bones. We were told he had a 55% chance of surviving the next 5 years. He had 20 months of treatment including 6 months chemotherapy, 12 hour major abdominal surgery where he was then intubated in ICU for 4 days following surgery,? two stem cells transplants with high dose chemotherapy being isolated in hospital for a month each time,? 12 rounds of radiation and 7 months of immunotherapy. On top of this he had 3 ICU admissions, a number of bacterial infections in his blood, had a central line in his chest for 18 months, 33 blood product transfusions, 25 general anaesthetics, 20 months being fed through a nasal gastric tube and 289 days in hospital.In March 2019, Nixon finished his treatment plan and his scans were clear.In September 2019, Nixon relapsed. Our oncologist said that his chance of surviving the next 5 years is very little. He started a trial of combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The treatment is extremely painful as it attacks the nerves throughout the body. Imagine having a tooth ache but that feeling is throughout your abdomen, arms,? hands, feet and legs. Because of this he is dosed up on double strength morphine/fentanyl and gabbapentin. This treatment will continue until mid October 2020 if there are no delays or complications.Nixon is at high risk of again relapsing. If he relapses again after this treatment, he will have a 0-2% chance of surviving. We simply cannot take this chance.Nixon's only hope for a cure is to get him to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York and participate in a vaccine trial against neuroblastoma. This trial is a course of 7 vaccines over 12 months. The trial has been ongoing for over 10 years!? But is not available in Australia.The purpose of the trial is for the body to make antibodies against the 2 antigens in the vaccine, those antibodies might also attach to neuroblastoma cells because a lot of each antigen is on neuroblastoma (and very little on other parts of the body). Then, the attached antibodies would attract the patient's white blood cells to kill the neuroblastoma. Stopping a relapse from occurring. This is Nixon's best chance of survival. As parents, we need to do everything we can to help our son survive.The costs associated with this vaccine trial is AU$350,000. The hospital fees alone are AU$232,000.All money raised (less fees) through the GoFundMe account is directly deposited into a bank account managed by Nixon's parents specifically for this treatment. A link to the trial can be found here. Please note that the trial states the estimated date of completion is May 2020 however I have been in contact with 2 of the head oncologists from MSK Cancer Cancer and also a head researcher for the trial. All have confirmed there is no end date for the trial and they will continue registering patients after May 2020:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00911560Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And Susan from hundreds of TV, film and theatrical roles over more than 4 decades.?Since meeting at the National Theatre School of Canada in the early 1970?ôs,?Michael and Susan?have lived and worked and raised children and grandchildren in Canada. To know them is to love them. ?And right now, they need our help. They?are private people ??so it has taken a long time for Susan to be comfortable sharing the harrowing story that changed their lives forever.??In Susan?ôs own words:????You probably know Michael as an actor. ?Or maybe you know him as a friend, an acquaintance, a co-worker, a father, a grandfather, or a husband. My husband. I am Susan Hogan and I am married to this extraordinary man. We have been each other?ôs best friend for decades.?On Feb. 17, 2020, everything changed drastically in our world.? Michael was in Vancouver participating in a Battlestar Galactica convention, and at dinner following his day?ôs work, he fell and hit his head. Hard. He went to bed that night not realizing that the impact had caused a massive brain bleed. ?He was unable to be woken the next morning and was taken to Vancouver General Hospital and emergency surgery performed. It took 57 staples to close the part of his scull they had to remove in order to reach the damage.?The accident left him with complete paralysis on his left side, memory loss, cogntivie impairment and an inability to swallow. ?Then things became incredibly more difficult during the COVID pandemic with visits by family being restricted then denied and no care team (physiotherapist,?OT, speech therapist, etc. ) allowed in.?Needless to say, this life changing injury has sent a tsunami of heartbreak through the family. And with recovery relying heavily on contact with family as critical members of the health care team, the agony of separation is indescribable.??Susan has been exhaustingly researching Michael?ôs frequently changing medical conditions, and is in daily contact with his doctors, nurses, specialists, and social workers.??On June 18th Michael was moved into The Berkley Care Centre in North Vancouver. Susan is allowed limited supervised visits - socially distanced, no contact, no touching, not even a smile can be exchanged given the mandatory face masks. For someone with a brain injury that face, that smile, that contact with a family member is critical grounding for them. To be denied that is torturous.??Susan has finally been able to find and get permission for a physiotherapist to go into the facility 2 or 3 times a week. Michael still cannot stand and needs an overhead lift to be moved from the bed to the wheelchair. He still requires a feeding tube into his stomach. He has regained his speech and is largely coherent and cognizant but there is a long long road ahead.??Though it is hard to imagine, I think it?ôs fair to say it is unlikely Michael will be able to work again but he is ONE TOUGH guy, so it also wouldn't surprise me if he found a way! ?But for these past seven months, Susan has also been unable to work, given the circumstances . She is facing an uncertain future to navigate other than knowing that the financial demands will continue to be great. There are the known costs of the Long Term Care facility, a customized wheelchair, a private physiotherapist to tend to him there, and ongoing costs of medications, foot care, adaptive clothing etc. And if he?ôs able to come home which would be far preferred - an overhead lift to move him from bed to wheelchair, a hospital bed, ramps, one to two live-in care-aids, renovations to accommodate the wheelchair including doorways and bathrooms, and a vehicle to accommodate the wheelchair.??It is impossible to accurately assess the ongoing and future financial demands so the ""goal"" will likely be a moving target. ?The real goal is to have Michael back ??that sweet, funny, teasing, impish spirited bright light and brilliant actor and friend. And if at all possible, one day back in his home on Bowen Island with his dog Harley, his family, and treasured parts of the life he knew. But practically speaking, the goal is to give Susan a way forward without the crushing financial weight of the ever changing costs for his care.?Of course, in these times there is increasing need and decreasing income due to Covid 19. But thanks to this platform any help you can provide for Susan and Michael as they navigate this new and difficult landscape will add up to a?significant difference in their lives. ?Considering the formidable contribution to theatre, film and television they have both made, I felt it worth asking.?Some folks without credit cards or not wanting to send money over the net are asking for other options ?to give. ?You can send funds directly via:PayPal.me/susanhogan77OR:Mail a cheque payable to?Susan HoganTO:Michael and Susan Hoganc/o Shari UlrichPO Box 152Bowen Island, BC ?V0N 1G0Thank you so much for listening and please share far and wide.?gf.me/u/yy53vx?Shari UlrichAnd Susan sent me this today.....""Just sitting at the coffee shop, where Michael and I would come every morning.

On Wednesday the 16th of May 2018, two weeks after his first birthday, I took Theo to my local GP when I felt a lump in his lower abdomen and was concerned that his belly was quite swollen.? We were immediately sent to University Hospital Limerick where they found a large tumour in Theo?ôs abdomen. He was taken by ambulance to Crumlin Children?ôs Hospital, Dublin, where he was diagnosed with Stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer that had spread to his bones and scalp.? By Saturday morning, he was having chemotherapy and our world had fallen apart.?Since then, Theo has had his tumour removed and gone through numerous? rounds of chemotherapy, a double stem cell transplant, fourteen rounds of radiotherapy and six rounds of immunotherapy. He has suffered setbacks along the way, including two very serious infections which had him admitted to Intensive Care. We have come scarily close to losing him, but Theo has defied all odds and battled through it. He is just about to finish his last round of immunotherapy, after which we are hopeful for a clear scan. Theo is only three and has been in treatment for two and a half years.?Unfortunately, with the type of cancer that Theo has, the chance of re-occurrence is extremely high. We now need help. Today, as Theo?ôs mum, I am asking you to help me get Theo on a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital Cancer Centre in New York.?This trial will help prevent the cancer re-occurring and greatly improve Theo?ôs chances of survival. Theo deserves a long, healthy life free from pain and fear. I have to do everything in my power to make sure he gets this. We need to raise ??75,000. Time is not on our side, as Theo needs to be in New York by January 2021, so we urgently need your help.?The last two and a half years have been incredibly tough, especially as a single parent. I have learned firsthand how precious life really is and how quickly it can all be taken away. I will be forever grateful for the love and kindness from people who have sent thoughts, prayers and good wishes, even those we?ôve never even met. And, of course, we are forever indebted to the wonderful staff in Crumlin Hospital and University Hospital Limerick, who have become like family to us.?I think the hardest part of cancer treatment is at the end, when everyone assumes you?ôre cured and you no longer need their help. This isn?ôt true.? Believe me, this is when you?ôre at your absolute weakest. I have laid my child in a surgeon?ôs arms and spent Christmas keeping watch over him in ICU. I have slept upright in a hospital chair and listened to the beeping of machines. I have smiled through the tears and found strength when there wasn?ôt any left. I have done it all for Theo, who is at the end of the day just a very normal, very precious boy, full of mischief, quick to smile, and a big fan of Tractor Ted and Paw Patrol. Today, I need my friends and community to help me give Theo the best future he can possibly have.???Thank you from the bottom of my heart.?Eleanor, Theo's MomRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By age 16, in 2019:-Raufoss 2 (3.division) with 15 matches and 2 goals-Raufoss G19 with 14 matches and 4 goalsBy age? 14,? in 2017 og 2018:-Raufoss G16 with 17 matches and 21 goals-Played for the Regional team and Norwegian Football federation with7 matches-Played for U14 nation tournament in NorwayThis all was turned upside down on 30.November 2019.The accident:? ? ?On a night that was meant to celebrate the ending of the football season, ended? ?disastrously for Saha when he and his friend decided to do a flip? together and collided mid-air. Seconds later Saha lied on the ground and was unable to move.His big brother (1 year older) and his friends managed to stabilize him and call the ambulance. When the ambulance came, they did not get any? response from his torso and legs, they called an ambulance helicopter wich took him to Oslo hospital.Here, they confirmed that he had broken his neck and disc C4-C5 wich is located at the top of the neck. He then underwent an 8 hour long surgery where they put? the discs back into place, but the damage to the spinal cord had already been done.?We were all sitting in the waiting room at the hospital when the surgeons came out and informed us that he had 1% chance of ever moving his legs again.?Our world was turned upside down.At the hospital, Saha was 2 days in induced coma. He was fed with painkillers and they tried to stabilize his blood pressure as much as possible.Finally when his blood pressure was stabilize enough, he then was transferred to Sunnaas rehabilitation center.It was here his biggest and toughest battle began.Our hopes and his mentality:Saha has always been a fighter. He never gives up, and has always worked hard. He is absolutely a beautiful human beeing that we love so much and we are so proud of. Because of his fighting mentality we are convinced that he will be able to walk again and both we and Saha are doing anything in? ? our power to help him achieve this goal.When Saha first arrived at Sunnaas, he was only able to move his left shoulder one cm up and down. Nothing else. Now after 6 months we have seen? his progress exceed beyond the expectations of the surgeons and doctors regarding patients with this type of spinal cord injury.? This summer he will be? discharged from Sunnaas after 6 months of intense rehabilitation.Our dream and his way forward:Due to limited treatments available in Norway, we have been searching international and found several facilities in countries such as Canada, USA, Thailand, Panama etc. These facilities provide all different ways of treatments such as epidural stimulation, stem cells therapy and intensive/high tech training with great success rate among patiens with Spinal cord injury. This have given them control and feeling back over muscles they previously did not have any control over.? Treatment decisions:Based on information gathered and several consultations with doctors and? specialist have we decided to? ? do the Epidural stimulation operation and stem cell treatment in Bangkok, thailand.This may give him the chance to stand and even perhaps take his first steps.The hospital/rehabilitation clinic is known worldwide and this treatments is the? ?newest within spinal cord injuries and giving hope to the patients.The hospital is owned by Verita Neuro Pte. Ltd. and is powered by Verita Health? care group.( https://epiduralstimulationnow.com/)Donations:The whole family are behind Saha and we are doing everything in our power to help him achieve his goal. We are also aware that this treatment is not the final treatment for him and that? he will be needing more in order to ever walk again.The treatment, surgery and facilitated training at the clinic in Bangkok are scoped out for Saha to cost a total of 4.2million NOK ($ 420 000). We as a family have already been able to afford around 2,2 million NOK ($220 000), for this purpose.Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to thank any of our friends who are willing to help us.? Every little thing matters. All of the amount assembled will be put in a fund and will only be used to pay for? ?and provide Saha with treatments that can help him take his first steps again and hopefully be able to one day walk again. Our sincere gratitude to everyone who will and could help us achieve this.We would also like to point out the importance of shared this between your friends and teammates as well.? It is important that we reach out to as many as possible.

Her last parents evening confirmed what we knew already ??Eva is always one to help her friends if she can, putting others needs and feelings before her own.? She is special.On 1st January 2020, our lives as a family were changed forever ??Eva was diagnosed with an inoperable, incurable, brain tumour known as DIPG.? This is rare disease which effects a small number of children each year ??it is so rare in fact, that in the last 50 years, there has been little progress in being able to identify ways to treat children with the diagnosis.Before that day, we had never heard of DIPG ??why would we?? It is a tumour which sits in the brain stem, making it impossible to remove, and because it effects the area which controls the major functions of the body, as it grows, there is one terrible outcome.Our nightmare started in the run up to New Year.? Eva had complained of dizziness and blurred vision, and so we organised a trip to the opticians.? At her appointment, Eva had seemed to lose some of the control of her eyes, and was unable to move them to the right.? We were referred to the hospital Ophthalmology department, and our appointment was scheduled for New Year?ôs Eve.Eva had her appointment at the hospital, and when a doctor is choking back tears, unable to tell you the problem, you know something is wrong.? We were immediately referred for an emergency CT Scan, and our hell began ??a ?òmass??appeared in the image, and we were informed that we would be headed to Alder Hey that evening.? Looking back, even at this point, I don?ôt think either of us could imagine what was coming?¶When we arrived at Alder Hey that evening, we were told that Eva would undertake an MRI the following day, and that would tell us exactly what we were dealing with, however that it was almost definitely a mass in the brain stem, which would be inoperable due to its location.? We spent New Year?ôs Eve together ??Eva, Carran and I ??in a room at Alder Hey, watching the fireworks as people celebrated the start of 2020.On New Year?ôs Day, Eva completed her MRI and we waited on the results.? Visits from grandparents and Eva?ôs two brothers helped pass the time, but we knew bad news was coming and it did?¶DIPG ??Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma ??is a name I will never ever forget:*? DIPG effects children, mainly between the ages of 2 and 12*? The average life expectancy post-diagnosis is less than 12 months*? There is no known cure*? Radiotherapy is the only known treatment, however it only provides a temporary relief in shrinking tumours, that subsequently grow back more aggressively than everThe facts of DIPG are things no parent should ever have to face ??and they are facts which we couldn?ôt bring ourselves to share with Eva.? She is an incredibly intuitive little girl, and so we have been as open as we feel that we can be, without sharing the prognosis.? Eva accepts this for now.As a family, because we have tried to protect Eva from all of the details of her diagnosis, we were very reluctant to start a crowd funding page.? When it comes to our children, you don?ôt see them all over social media, and we are very private about family life, and so this is incredibly hard to set up, however as a parent, you do everything you can to protect your children.I?ôll reiterate that there is no cure ??we understand that.? That said, there are medical trials taking place all over the world, lead by medical teams who fight day and night to try to find something to save our children.? Unfortunately, many of these trials are unavailable in the UK, and many are unavailable in Europe.? Because of this, any potential treatment ??which may extend Eva?ôs life ??is highly expensive and difficult to access.We have found a clinical trial in the US which has been proven to have positive effects on the tumours ??a drug developed by a company called Oncoceutics, which shows huge promise in targeting DIPG.? After conversations with our consultant, we are aiming to get Eva on the trial, however the cost starts at ¬£250,000 and so without help, we are unable to access this.And so, Carran and I are putting aside our concerns about sharing this publicly, and are instead asking, begging, for help.? We are asking for you to donate anything you can ??no matter how big or small ??to help us to access the best possible treatment for Eva, and therefore to provide her the best possible chance of beating this.Any funds raised will be used to provide Eva with medical care, access to medicine, and any possible clinical trials.? If we find ourselves in a position where we do not require the funds raised, we will be donating to DIPG charities and to children suffering with this disease.Thank you so much for your help.Paul and Carran xxRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Il circuito, tramite un tubo e una pompa, preleva sangue dal paziente e lo immette nel polmone artificiale, qui il sangue subisce un processo di ossigenazione con rimozione di anidride carbonica e poi viene reimmesso in circolo nell'organismo.Il prelievo sanguigno avviene sempre dal circolo venoso, mentre la reintroduzione del sangue ossigenato pu√≤ avvenire sia nel circolo venoso (ECMO veno-venosa) sia in quello arterioso (ECMO veno-arteriosa).Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is a happy, energetic, intelligent and thoughtful person, one of the most quick-witted, funny and charming human beings to grace the lives of those that are lucky enough to call him their friend. One of his greatest traits is that he has the unique ability to turn negativity into positivity. Throughout his entire illness, he has not complained once. He is a dedicated husband to his amazing wife Jocelyn, and the best father to his unbelievably cute 1-year old daughter Windsor (and dog Nash). He is the son of Roberta and Dennis, and the big brother of Thomas. Growing up, hockey was a big part of his life, from playing to coaching. He has had a profound impact on not only his inner circle of friends, but his community as well. It would be impossible to find anyone that after meeting Dan, would have anything negative to say about him. Dan has impacted so many lives in so many ways and now it?ôs our turn to help impact his.?Dan and Jocelyn were married in Calgary in August of 2017; a romantic ceremony surrounded by their friends and family, with lots of good food and drinks, laughs, and the most love you could fit into a room. Their souls were truly meant for each other and it was a magical and memorable evening.Shortly thereafter concern was raised when Dan started to experience painful headaches with seemingly no answer as to why they were occurring. After many doctors??visits and no true answers, the headaches started to get progressively worse. The first major incident that Dan experienced was in June 2017 (his birthday) where he fainted. At the time, everyone assumed it was a one-off incident caused from either working too much or lack of sleep. Little did we know that the fainting incident was not something minor, but something much more severe; it was in fact a focal seizure.After going through countless tests and more doctor and hospital visits, on February 5th of 2018 Dan started to experience some numbness in his body and shared this with his doctor. The Doctor strongly advised that Dan go and get an MRI at a private clinic. It was a good thing that Dan did because the results of the MRI showed a mass in his brain and he was sent immediately to the hospital for further analysis.After meeting with the specialists, the Hickey?ôs then learnt that the mass in Dan?ôs brain was, in fact, a tumour. After careful consideration and consultation with the specialists, the decision was made to move forward with surgery in hopes of removing as much of the tumor as possible in order to give Dan the best chance of removing it completely after with chemo and radiation. They proceeded with the surgery and unfortunately, it didn?ôt go as well as everyone had hoped. The result of the surgery was that they only removed 10-15% of the mass when the goal had been to remove at least 75%. Post-surgery testing was done on the removed mass and it was confirmed that the mass was what we all feared, an astrocytoma tumor. At this time they needed to make a very critical decision regarding treatment going forward and so Dan sought out a second opinion.During this chaotic and terrifying time Dan and Jocelyn had some incredible news; Jocelyn was pregnant with their beautiful daughter.?In March of 2018, the Hickey?ôs sought out a second opinion since due to the size of the mass, if they proceeded with the initial recommendation to treat the tumor with radiation the chances of that being successful were slim. At this point they met a surgeon by the name of Dr. Kelly. Dr. Kelly took on Dan?ôs case and provided his recommendation which was very troubling and hard to fathom. Even though Dan had just gone through the incredibly invasive and painful surgery just a month prior, the best route was to go through another surgery, but this time they would be much more aggressive in removing as much as they could which also meant elevated risks associated with the procedure.On March 25th Dan went in for his second operation. This time the surgery was very successful and the bulk of the tumor was removed with no complications or further damage done to Dan.?After the surgery, Dan was put on a heavy schedule of chemo and radiation. He persevered through every treatment like a champ.?On September 4, 2018 Jocelyn gave birth to their adorable baby girl.?As the Hickey?ôs adjusted to the newest addition, everything was going smoothly. Dan completed his chemo and radiation in May 2019, and to celebrate, his friends and family threw him a big party to commemorate the incredible feat that Dan and his family had overcome. ?Things were going well and Dan was doing as well as anyone could have hoped for health wise despite what he had just overcome. They enjoyed sharing beautiful moments together and celebrated Windsor?ôs first birthday.?Shortly after Windsor?ôs birthday, Dan was required to do another MRI, which was routine to ensure that the tumor was dormant and to check on his health. Unfortunately, the results of that MRI were not what anyone had anticipated; the MRI showed the return of the cancerous growth. This time the growth was in multiple places and would need to be treated again through extensive chemo/radiation in order to show progress before any further treatment could be considered.?On January 14, 2020, Dan?ôs tumor was upgraded from an Astrocytoma to a Glioblastoma; a very aggressive form of cancer that requires extensive care. A further scan showed that the tumors were not responding to treatment and continuing to grow.Dan has since been removed from the medical trial of chemotherapy that he had been put on and now the priority is keeping him comfortable at home, surrounded by the love of his family and friends.?Dan is a warrior; now it is our turn to fight for him.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,Cure Kinley & Kennedy (via Cure GM1 Foundation),"Created June 25, 2020","Medical, Illness & Healing","$2,000,000 ","$271,435 ",3.1K,8.4K,3.1K,"?úTwo of your children have a fatal, untreatable disease - they are dying???That is the news we received for two of our beautiful daughters, Kinley (7) and Kennedy (4), the morning after our third daughter, Kieran, was born. ? Without warning, we were faced with the sobering realization that our baby girls are dying.? Before this disease takes them, Kinley and Kennedy will very slowly lose their ability to walk, talk, eat?¶and even smile.We have been on a 4 year journey trying to understand what might be causing the developmental delays Kinley has been experiencing.? After countless appointments and evaluations with specialists from nearly every medical field, we finally received our answer on June 5th 2020 - the one we never saw coming. A full genetic screening revealed that not only Kinley, but her younger sister Kennedy both have an extremely rare genetic disorder called GM1 Gangliosidosis.? We are forever thankful that baby Kieran is not affected by this wretched disease.?Currently, there is no approved treatment or cure for GM1, and it is always fatal in children.********OUR NEW REALITYGM1 Gangliosidosis is an aggressive disease where the body does not produce adequate enzymes to break down certain molecules. Instead, these molecules collect on the brain and spinal cord, leading to widespread neurodegeneration. The list of complications that our girls face is truly terrifying and the idea of watching them slowly fade away is our worst nightmare.?Right now, Kinley and Kennedy are in a relatively ?ústable??state in their disease progression.? They can still walk independently and are verbal, though both are experiencing speech issues that make them hard to understand.? Looking at them, one would never know they both face such a grave fate, but there will come a day where each of them will no longer be able to run outside with their friends, jump on their trampoline, or tell their baby sister ?úI love you??if no treatments are developed.? ?Kinley, who wants nothing more than to be a doctor, nurse, or vet so she can help other people, will eventually not be able to take care of herself independently. ?Kennedy, who loves to dance and sing and dress up, will someday not be able to do her infamous twirls and leaps, or ?úfreeze??you with her Elsa powers.Each morning, we wake to the reality that we are another day closer to that outcome.? One day, they won?ôt recognize their mom and dad.? One day, they won?ôt be able to tell us they need something, or that they love us.? One day, they will require a feeding tube.? One day,? we will lay two of our precious babies to rest.Life expectancy for the type of GM1 Kinley and Kennedy have is difficult to predict, but estimates range anywhere from mid-childhood (10-15 years old) to the early twenties. ?We are hopeful that both Kinley and Kennedy have many more great years ahead of them at a quality of life that they both deserve. ? There is no way to know at what point the disease will firm its grip on Kinley and Kennedy - we are in a race against time.SOME HOPE - IT'S NOT TOO LATEThere are several treatment clinical trials coming up for both substrate suppression therapy and gene therapy through drug companies, universities, and the NIH.? This Page is a mission of hope for our family and others impacted by GM1 Gangliosidosis, and provides support to ensure these trials and developments continue. We are committed to raising awareness of this horrid disease, and promoting funding for continued research and the advancement of current clinical trials that may eventually be accessible to these children, including our own.? In fact, some believe a cure is imminent - it simply needs the support and dollars to advance. ?We are not naive to the fact, however, that clinical trial spots are very, very limited?and are experimental, so there are never guarantees...but we do know that our girls do not need to suffer!We intend to soak in every moment with Kinley and Kennedy while they can still run, dance, sing, and just be kids.? We now know how precious each and every day is, and appreciate every time we hear the words ?úI love you??from them, or hear them sing lullabies to their baby sister.? While continuing to give our girls all the love we can, and show them the world as best we can, we simply must fight to find off-label treatments to slow the progression long enough for a cure to be developed.We will still show them the world, provide experiences even seasoned adults have never had, and make sure every moment they have on this earth is not taken for granted.?OUR GOALDeveloping treatments in the United States is notoriously expensive.? For gene therapy specifically, it is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 for a single clinical trial participant*. ?We are raising $2,000,000 - the conservative estimate for both Kinley and Kennedy to participate in a gene therapy trial.? We refuse to sit idly while our babies bodies slowly betray them and we can only achieve this goal with your support.? Every dollar is immensely important, and sharing the information with your network can and will work miracles.? Reaching this goal won?ôt guarantee Kinley and Kennedy treatment, but it will go far in advancing the development of the cures we and families in our position so desperately desire.We all say ?úwe will do anything for our children??? We?ôre asking for you to help us in this journey so our children and other families in our position can retain hope that there is a better future for our babies.SPECIFIC WAYS TO HELP1) ?If you?ôre in a position to do so, please consider a donation.?

Sadly, after 9 months of aggressive chemotherapy and multiple surgeries, the cancer has returned, and now there are multiple tumours throughout his body. He has started chemotherapy again, but his oncologist has advised that this is just a short-term solution, and it won?ôt be able to cure him. This means that he will need further treatment that the NHS cannot provide. We?ôre pleading to you for help in raising $450,000 for his enrolment onto CAR-T cell immunotherapy in the USA.Ammaar was diagnosed with bone cancer when he was just 5 years old. He fell over whilst playing with his brothers at home one afternoon, but we didn't think much of it. However, the next day he was in a lot of pain, so we took him for an x-ray, which detected a 9.6cm tumour in his left leg (distal femur bone). A needle biopsy carried out a week later confirmed the diagnosis - high grade osteoblastic Osteosarcoma, Stage 2b. Within 2 weeks his treatment started - he went through 9 sessions of aggressive chemotherapy at the UCLH in London, then limb salvage surgery @ the RNOH in London, followed by a further 9 sessions of chemotherapy, which finally ended in February 2019. Ammaar rang the bell and cut a cake to celebrate his discharge from hospital, and we left thinking that he was cured. However, we were wrong.A few months later, we noticed a small lump on his right collarbone, and after several scans and another needle biopsy, the doctors confirmed that the tumour was back, and it had managed to re-appear in a completely different part of his body. His right collarbone was surgically removed on 9th September, and another surgery followed ~6 weeks later to remove yet another tumour that was growing nearby. Sadly, the most recent PET scan dated 4th November 2019 highlighted several new tumours throughout his body (ankle, hip, lower back, lungs, shoulder and upper right chest. We had no choice but for him to start chemotherapy again at the UCLH, which is expected to last ~5 months. However, Ammaar's oncologist has advised that the chemotherapy will not be able to cure him, and as a result, we have no choice but to seek medical treatment elsewhere. The good news is that cutting edge CAR-T Cell immunotherapy treatment is available for our son in the USA; however, it is shockingly expensive, and being a UK national, Ammaar's treatment in the USA is not covered by the NHS. The treatment on its own is expected to cost around USD $450,000. Moreover, we need to raise a minimum of USD $75,000 just to cover the initial costs (hospital admission for 4 weeks, full medical consultation & treatment plan etc). The initial funds would be required by end-January 2020. As a family we are doing all we can to raise the money for Ammaar?ôs treatment; however, being such a massive amount, we had to make the tough decision to set up this GoFundMe page.?We are very hopeful that this new & innovative treatment will not only kill the existing tumours in Ammaar?ôs body, but that it will also prevent any more tumours from growing in the future, so that our son can live a long & healthy life going forward. Any money you are able to donate towards our son's treatment will be so greatly appreciated. Please kindly also share this page with your family & friends.

I can?ôt even begin to describe how the most recent diagnosis made me feel.Lotte and I drove home from the hospital and plucked up the courage to call mum, my brother and his partner to let them know. We wanted more than anything to be together, to hug each other and make it all ok, but due to Covid-19 we couldn?ôt.It took some time, but eventually we came to the conclusion that, I am simply too young to accept this prognosis, and I will not give up.We immediately began an ongoing process of researching every possible thing that I could do (conventional and integrative) to change the course of history I found myself on. We had what felt like daily Zoom consultations with practitioners around the world - discussing different treatments, arranging tests, ordering supplements, radically changing diet, speaking to therapists, embracing meditation and breathwork, taking in as much information as we could and trying to make sense of it all.Many of our friends and colleagues connected us to specialists around the world who out of the goodness of their hearts, spoke to us (some for hours at a time) offering their perspective on my situation and what could be done.MPNST is a very difficult cancer to treat - it is widely regarded as being ?únon-chemosensitive?? effectively this means that traditional chemotherapy doesn't work.The NHS suggested that I have surgery (one lung at a time) to remove as much of the cancer as they can. As I share this I am recovering well from my first surgery.The NHS propose to follow up surgery with chemotherapy to ?úmanage the disease??(or in other words, buy some time). We are embracing surgery with open arms and feel fortunate to have an amazing surgeon within the NHS, but bog standard chemo that isn?ôt likely to work just doesn?ôt feel good enough for a long term outcome.We are more hopeful than that. There are other forms of treatment, targeted therapies and immunotherapies that can in some cases have better outcomes that we want to explore after surgery. Eligibility for these depends on certain genetic mutations which need to be tested for using expensive molecular testing and DNA sequencing, something that is not available as standard through the NHS. If I have certain genetic mutations, I might be eligible for some of these more promising treatments, and maybe even beat this thing!Whilst I?ôm not turning my back on the NHS who have been in so many ways amazing up until this point - we need to form the right team of people, do the necessary testing and create an individualised treatment plan for me, no matter what or where in the world this takes place.I just don?ôt have the financial resources to do all of this alone.I realise this is probably the worst time ever to be fundraising. Not just because the financial implications of COVID-19 are hitting everybody hard, but also because there are so many other important causes out there that need your help.Why donate to me rather than the NHS, or one of the many COVID relief efforts? Why do I deserve money from anybody when there are hundreds of thousands of people suffering around the world? What makes me so special? Honestly these are all questions I?ôve been going over again and again in my mind. But I have to ask. If I don?ôt ask, you won?ôt know that I need help.Following the encouragement of close friends and family, I have created this Gofundme page where you can give as much or as little as you feel able.Your donations will help me to fund the molecular testing and consultations with specialists who are using forward thinking treatments to help people like me have better outcomes. The molecular testing is likely to cost ¬£20,000 and I will also need to take an extensive list of supplements and medications. We are grateful to have found, and be communicating with someone with a very similar diagnosis to me who is successfully shrinking her tumours using a non-toxic supplement and medication protocol that would cost around ¬£1,500 pcm.So for my molecular testing, the guidance of these specialists and for a year?ôs worth of the current supplement & medication protocol, I?ôm looking to raise ¬£50,000. If targeted treatments do become an option as well, this can cost a lot more and at the moment I?ôm unsure as to quite how much.I appreciate these are big numbers and this is going to be a big challenge, but the advice we?ôve had from people who?ôve been in a similar position to me is ?úwhatever you do, don?ôt let money be a barrier to getting the right treatment.?ùI appreciate that not everybody is in a position to donate money, but there may be other ways you can help me, even just sharing my story, incase somebody that you know is in a position to help?These have been the most challenging weeks of my life and I am so grateful for all of the support I?ôve had from friends, family and colleagues so far. I cry every day due to the acts of kindness.Thanks for taking time to read my story.Ben xRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rare and aggressive form of childhood cancer affects approximately 7 to 10 children a year in Ireland. At the outset of this difficult journey we were told that treatment would take 18 months. The good news is that he is responding well to treatment - 13 rounds of chemotherapy, two major surgeries, two stem cell transplants, 14 rounds of radiotherapy and multiple bone marrow aspirates, blood transfusions and other medical procedures (in the midst of a global health pandemic). With little disease left, he is now in the last phase of his treatment plan in Crumlin - immunotherapy, which he will complete by the end of the year.? Hopefully, this will lead to the clear scan result that we are so desperately waiting for.??Even though he has endured so much, Stage 4 Neuroblastoma has an extremely high relapse rate, and very little treatment options if relapse occurs. Sadly, this results in low survival rates. There is a clinical trial for a vaccine that helps prevent relapse in Neuroblastoma children in the Slone Kettering Memorial Hospital in New York. The vaccine has had very promising Phase 1 results and we will do everything in our power to save our wonderful boy and get Auryn this treatment. This vaccine is not available in Ireland, so our only option is to travel overseas. We have set up this fundraising campaign called Auryn's Heroes and are seeking to fundraise ??75k by January 2021.? All funds raised will go towards getting Auryn the treatment he needs.This cancer journey has impacted Auryn and our family so much, taking an enormous toll on both Auryn's physical and mental wellbeing. Aside from all the horrible medical procedures, he has missed out on so much of his childhood in the last year - the simple things that people take for granted have been denied to him. Due to his compromised immune system and constant risk of infection, we were required to keep him indoors, out of school and away from other children. Going into a shop, visiting another person's home, or having a playdate with other children are some examples of things that have been out of reach for Auryn for months and months on end. He has been surrounded by sadness, unspeakable horrors in hospital and endured medical procedure after procedure.?

D√©termin√© ? passer au travers de cette √©preuve, il a d√ª supporter la chimioth√©rapie, l?ôablation totale de l?ôestomac et de la moiti√© de l?ô≈ìsophage pour finalement annoncer au temps des F√™tes 2019, qu?ôil √©tait maintenant gu√©ri du cancer. Une autre grande nouvelle l?ôattendait en juillet 2020 lorsqu?ôil a appris que son amoureuse, Mari√®ve Lalibert√©, donnerait naissance ? leur premier enfant en mars 2021.Malheureusement, les sympt√¥mes de la maladie sont r√©apparus seulement quelques semaines apr√®s avoir appris qu?ôil deviendrait p√®re. Il a re√ßu r√©cemment la terrifiante nouvelle que le cancer √©tait revenu, plus agressif que jamais, au stade 4. Avec des options limit√©es au Qu√©bec, Antoine et Mari√®ve doivent se tourner sous recommandation des sp√©cialistes, vers des traitements et essais cliniques principalement offerts aux ?tats-Unis. Ces traitements sont pour Antoine une porte de sortie qui lui offrent les meilleures chances d?ôaccueillir son enfant ? venir. C?ôest une situation d?ôautant plus bouleversante que ce type de cancer est extr√™mement rare ? cet √¢ge et que la recherche y est tr√®s limit√©e.?La bataille initialeC?ôest en mars 2019 qu?ôAntoine a appris la terrible nouvelle qu?ôil devrait commencer une chimioth√©rapie agressive pour un cancer de l?ôestomac de stade 3. Antoine √©tait un jeune homme de 27 ans tr√®s actif, ne correspondant en rien au profil type d?ôune personne atteinte du cancer de l?ôestomac. Arm√© d?ôun grand courage et appuy√© par sa famille, ses amis et surtout sa belle Mari√®ve, Antoine a d√©but√© son combat contre le cancer quelques semaines apr√®s le premier diagnostic. Apr√®s 4 traitements de chimioth√©rapie, Antoine a d√ª subir l?ôablation totale de l?ôestomac et d?ôune partie de son ?sophage, car le cancer se situait ? la jonction des deux organes. Comme mesure pr√©ventive, le chirurgien a √©galement retir√© une petite partie du pancr√©as et une cinquantaine de ganglions lymphatiques. Huit semaines apr√®s la chirurgie, Antoine √©tait de retour, avec le m√™me aplomb qu?ôau d√©part, pour un deuxi√®me cycle de chimioth√©rapie qui avait pour but de r√©duire au maximum les risques de r√©cidives. ? l?ôaube des F√™tes 2019, Antoine et Mari√®ve ont eu la confirmation qu?ôils pouvaient maintenant mettre cette histoire derri√®re eux puisqu?ôil n?ôy avait plus aucune trace de cellules canc√©reuses dans son organisme.Un bonheur immense suivi d?ôune nouvelle cr√®ve-c?urAyant une soif de vivre renouvel√©e et de nombreux de projets en t√™te, Antoine et Mari√®ve ont appris ? l?ô√©t√© 2020 la nouvelle excitante de la venue de leur premier enfant. Leur c√©l√©bration a malheureusement √©t√© interrompue quelques semaines plus tard lorsqu?ôils ont appris que le cancer √©tait de retour et avait √©volu√© au stade 4.Apr√®s avoir appris cette terrible nouvelle, Antoine et Mari√®ve se sont engag√©s ? faire tout ce qui √©tait n√©cessaire pour faire face et s?ôattaquer ? ce nouveau diagnostic. Toutefois, le cancer de stade 4 peut lui donner une esp√©rance de vie entre 4 mois et 3 ans, au mieux, s?ôil s?ôen tient au protocole de chimioth√©rapie qu?ôil a d√©j? commenc√©. Son oncologue a fortement recommand√© ? Antoine d?ôenvisager un traitement au-del? de sa ville natale de Val-d?ôOr.

The next months required him to endure chemotherapy, the removal of his stomach, esophagus, and additional months of chemo.? Finally, at Christmas 2019, he was able to share with those closest to him that he was cancer free.? Life seemed to have turned the corner for good when in July of 2020 he learned his love Mari√®ve and he would welcome a child into this world in April of 2021.This joy was short lived as soon Antoine started feeling ill again.? He has just recently learned the horrifying news that his cancer was back and as aggressive as ever at Stage 4.? With limited options in Canada, they must turn to clinical trials in the US to give him the greatest odds of welcoming his child into this world.? There is limited medical knowledge of this type of cancer as it is extremely rare, aggressive, and uncommon for a healthy person in their 20s.The Initial FightMarch 2019 brought extremely shocking news to Antoine Frappier when he learned that he would need to begin intense chemotherapy for Stage 3 stomach cancer.? Antoine has always been an active healthy young man and at 27 years of age did not fit the profile of a stomach cancer candidate.? With a positive attitude and perseverance, as well as his beautiful Mari√®ve at his side, Antoine began the cancer journey.? After 4 rounds of chemotherapy and regaining some of the weight he initially lost, the surgeon decided that it was best to remove Antoine?ôs stomach and part of his esophagus because the cancer was at the junction of the two organs. As a preventative measure, the surgeon also removed a small portion of his pancreas and approximately 50 lymph nodes.? Eight weeks after surgery, Antoine began the remaining 4 rounds of chemotherapy.? Throughout the ordeal, Antoine remained positive in facing his cancer treatment and adjusting to his new way of life.? On Christmas Day 2019, Antoine shared with family and friends the news that he was cancer free!? ?A Bundle of Joy Followed by Earth Shattering NewsThe end of summer 2020 brought exciting news for Antoine and Mari√®ve when they learned that they were expecting a baby!? Their wonderful announcement and celebration were disrupted a few weeks later when they learned that the cancer had reared its ugly head once again.? After hearing the devastating news, Antoine and Mari√®ve have vowed to do whatever was necessary to deal with and attack this cancer diagnosis; however, Stage 4 cancer may give him anywhere from a mere 4 months to 3 years at the very best with the chemotherapy protocol he has already started.? Unfortunately, there are no new treatments or clinical trials in Val-d?ôOr or the Montreal area.? After consulting with his oncologist, Antoine and Mari√®ve have decided to look beyond their home of Val-d?ôOr for a second opinion, either elsewhere in Canada or in the United States.? The NeedThe battle to welcome his child into this world will mean both Antoine and Mari√®ve will need to take a leave of absence from their jobs with loss of income. As they will need to travel internationally to the United States, many medical costs will not be covered by their Canadian based insurance, not to mention the travel, lodging, and food costs which will add up quickly.? Just initial contact with many of the leading cancer centers in the United States identified that initial deposits for international patient evaluations for possible admission to clinical trials range from $10,000 to $250,000.? These are merely initial deposits and do not include the cumulative costs to access potentially miracle inducing treatments.? A family friend in the United States survived stage 3 breast cancer, and had she not had insurance, her medical costs would have costed over $1 Million US Dollars. ?The askWithout the financial means for Antoine?ôs battle to witness the birth of his child and assume the role of Daddy which he so deserves, we humbly ask you to join us on this journey.? Because time is critical, we need to raise as much money as possible in an expeditious manner to allow him to consult with several US cancer centers to start the best treatment and/or clinical trial that has the greatest chance of success.?? We are setting a the goal at $250,000. We know this is a big ask, but we have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of support so far. As we understand more about the full costs of treatment - we will provide updates to everyone to be as transparent as possible.?We thank you in advance for your love, support, and prayers and ask you to also share this with as many of your family and friends as you can.? No child deserves to only know their daddy from pictures and the memories of others. Help us on this journey to make sure Antoine and Mari√®ve can raise their sweet little baby together. In the unlikely event we collect more funds than needed to endure this fight, excess proceeds will be given to organizations researching these types of rare and tragic cancers.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ali has Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1 disease.?Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 is the most severe form of the SMA disease that disable people by affecting the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, taking away the ability to walk, eat, or breathe. Most of the babies do not survive before the age of 2 and it is the number one genetic cause of death for infants during their sleep.There is an approved gene therapy, which is called Zolgensma. It costs (together with hospital expenses) more than 2,100 million euro in Europe and is also available for babies older than 2 years old, until they are 21kg.?We received an offer from Hungary to treat him, unfortunately the cost is not within our power.Only with this treatment, we can keep Ali alive. He is now 26 months old and 9.5kg. He cannot gain weight because of the disease and recently developed breathing problems. He is losing muscle skills every day and one day he will not be able to breath by himself during his sleep. We want to save him before that.Thank you very much for your all support. You can find all the documents in the uploads section.Below I share the history of Agum Family?????Our son Ali Eymen was born in April 2018, earlier than we expected him. We were extremely happy to have a child, amazed by watching his development every day. When he was 6 months old, we began to realize that something was going wrong with his development and we started visiting doctors. After seeing different doctors in different hospitals, having many sleepless nights wondering what the problem with Ali was, we were introduced with SMA disease. He had Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type-1 disease, the most severe form of SMA. He was never going to be able to run, walk, eat, and even breath by himself at some point. We were devastated. ?Ali, is currently 26 months old, looks like just other babies smiling and happy, living with a disease that kills him inside, day by day. We were able to keep him alive and relatively healthy until this point thanks to the Spinraza drug given from his spinal cord every 4 months. But this drug is not going to keep him alive forever. It is only postponing the process. He is rehabilitated everyday to keep his muscles strong, so that he could heal properly when he finally gets the treatment that will save him.?This treatment is the most expensive drug in the world, Zolgensma gene therapy, given one time from the vein and fixing the nonfunctional SMA1 gene in the body. We received an offer from Hungary to get this treatment. Unfortunately, it costs more than 2,100 euro including the hospital expenses. ?Ali needs your donations for this treatment, to stay alive and to be able to walk and move like his friends. Our only dream is to be able to give him this treatment and see the day he is developing forward, not reverse. Everyday he does not get this treatment, he is losing more neurons and moving one step back from this dream.

Everyday it was a joy to see him but with him being born early we were also very worried and kept an eye on his progress as the days and weeks went past.?6 months passed and we noticed there was something wrong with our baby boy and that?ôs when our long journey started. We travelled a lot to different doctors, every night was filled with anxiety and sleepless nights but after searching for an answer our little boy got diagnosed with SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) at just 8 months. Ali can?ôt walk, run or even eat because of SMA. This diagnoses absolutely broke our hearts in half.Our son looks like every normal baby from the outside, smiling and laughing the day away??but at the moment we can only support him but this doesn?ôt secure his life?¶¬†The United States offers Spinraze drug also known as Nusinersen along with specialist doctors that specializes in Zolgensma Gene Therapy. This medication is part of the new treatment research. This medication exists to slow down the progression of the disease. Although this drug sadly doesn?ôt correct the main gene that causes the disease and sadly there isn?ôt any cure but we are fighting for more years with our little boy.We provide Ali with physical therapy everyday and he also has a machine that provides him with air that is used at a everyday basis, but he is getting worse and worse and this drug is our only option.?Every parent wants what is best for their child and to see them grow and be independent?? for us all we want is to see him get better and hopefully for him to gain some of his mobility and for us not to be filled with anxiety everyday and every night.The overall cost that we are trying to raise is $2.4 million which includes hospital costs.

Please offer whatever assistance you can as we wish for speedy health, recovery, and justice for Justin.??""His name is Justin Howell. And he is my little brother.As this column?has argued?before, if you really want to know what happened, there is no substitute for the?raw, unedited video. In it, you will see five people carrying Justin?ôs limp body toward police headquarters, begging the officers to get him medical attention. As they do, the police fire some 15 rounds (many of which were at the protesters carrying my brother) over the course of about 30 seconds.?úWhat the f---???one of them yells.Exactly.Because the five people carrying Justin weren?ôt ?úbegging??to get him medical attention ??at least not in the typical sense. According to Chief of Police Brian Manley in a?recent press briefing, the protesters ?úwere given direction to bring [Justin] to the officers??after which the demonstrators ?úwere fired upon with less-lethal munitions as they brought [Justin] towards the officers to get him medical help.?ùThink about that. It?ôs unclear whether the officers who shot at the protesters were the same ones who gave them the order to approach. But at minimum, it takes a special kind of incompetence to fire at those who are doing as the police tell them. At minimum, it shows a complete inability to be aware of your surroundings and to manage the situation appropriately.There is no better evidence that here in Austin, Texas, the police are entirely out of their depth.I confirmed Manley?ôs account with a man named David Frost over Twitter. He was the one who filmed the aforementioned video, and he was able to provide me with another picture of my brother shortly after being hit. In the photo, his body is splayed upon the ground. Onlookers are rushing to his side.In our brief interview, Frost told me that ?úother protesters were throwing rocks, water bottles, and a backpack. [Justin] was not. The chief of police even said on Facebook live today. They shot the WRONG person.?ù¬†Indeed, Manley did admit as much during his briefing. But it?ôs worth considering that this is the world in which we live: If the police tell you something, it?ôs best to get a second source to confirm its accuracy.It?ôs also notable in his briefing how little effort Manley puts into taking responsibility for what happened. No, reader, I haven?ôt omitted the part of Manley?ôs statement where he seems contrite. There was no apology. Instead, he sat at his desk for three full minutes, gave us the details above and at no point apologized to my brother, my family or the five brave protesters who carried Justin to police headquarters under fire. (To those protesters: My family sees you, and we thank you.)And what is somehow worse, Manley concludes his remarks by saying: ?úWe are praying for this young man and his family and we are hoping that his condition improves quickly. ?ùTo which my family, a deeply religious one, says this: We aren?ôt interested in your prayers. We are interested in you appropriately using the responsibilities with which the people of Austin have entrusted you. Prayer is not an excuse to abdicate responsibility.And responsible you are. Because Justin won?ôt be improving quickly. ?úIt will be a marathon, not a sprint,??according to one of his doctors.He has a fractured skull. He has brain damage. Doctors anticipate that when he wakes up, he will have difficulty telling his left from his right.These ?úless-lethal??munitions are only ?úless-lethal??by technicality. My brother?ôs condition shows what can happen when you fire them into a crowd.Earlier this week, the Austin-American Statesman reported that the Austin City Council ?úwill hold an emergency hearing [on Thursday] to address concerns about officer?ôs response to racial justice protests over the weekend and to address what they see as little cooperation from Austin police leadership to transform policies.?ùWe shall see if anything comes of it.

73,Help us complete Vanessa?ôs cancer treatment,"Created April 29, 2020","Medical, Illness & Healing","kr250,000","kr213,415",229,1K,229,"Six weeks ago, on the 27th of February, exactly six months after we got married, exactly five months after we unbelievingly heard the doctors describe the brain tumor diagnosis ( with the ensuing battle of standard treatments for this cancer - surgery twice, heavy radiotherapy, and two months of chemotherapy), our oncologists and brain surgeons ( including a prominent brain cancer researcher ), told us that there was no way to stop the brain tumor in Vanessa?ôs head, and all we could ( and should! ) do was to go home and try to enjoy the remaining weeks she had to live. It is impossible for me to describe how terrifying this was, especially thinking about our two boys of 2 and 4 years old, losing the most important person in their lives. ?And it is very difficult to impress on you how insanely brave my Vanessa is: On the very next day, February 28, non other than the-love-of-my-life?òs 40th birthday, Vanessa literally charged out and pleaded to other doctors to help us start the adjuvant alternative treatments that we believed, and now know, could help us beat braincancer. Before her 40th birthday was over, she had convinced two doctors to help us start up treatments.She is my warrior, and would not, will not, give up on herself, her two boys, or me in this battle, even if our hospital healthcare practitioners did. So from February 28, we have started up metabolic pathway treatments based on many promising scientific studies, all focused on improving the effectiveness of cancer cell death during chemotherapy. The result now, six weeks later, is that we turned a 50% tumor growth increase every 6-8 weeks during the five months of radiation and chemotherapy, into a 15% REDUCTION of tumor during the last six weeks of metabolic treatments in addition to chemotherapy. Ironically enough, our ?úBest Healthcare System in the world??actively discourages these treatments, while they are readily supported and available by healthcare institutions and health insurances in most other countries like Germany, the UK and the US. In Norway, even the best private healthcare insurances don?ôt cover promising adjuvant metabolic treatments. This was a shock to us.During these six months, helped by my yet-to-be-usefull bachelor in molecular biology, I learned how these metabolic pathway treatments focus on changing different metabolic processes in our bodies so that the tumor is as best possible starved of its nutrients for its defective extreme growth. This in turn, together with traditional chemotherapy, which in Vanessas case is Telozolomide which targets the DNA and replication processes, can double or triple the rate of cancer cell death. The difference in result can therefore ??úmagically??leaps from just marginally slowing down tumor growth, to actually reducing the tumor! Certain death turns to continued life! It all makes sense in theory, and now that we see it works, it has turned our darkest moments of fear, into our bright hope of miraculously BEATING BRAINCANCER!But unfortunately, these alternative treatments are expensive, and neither our government health care services, our social welfare system, nor our expensive health insurances, cover our expenses. The different treatments cost us approximately 15 000 NOK ( 1 500 USD ) per month, not including transport, parking, extra daycare help needed, and other indirect costs which from October last year amounts to over 100 000 NOK (10 000 USD ). When we do our accounts to see how we can cover the impact our current battle has had these past six months, and calculate continued treatments for at least the remainder of the year, we see that we are struggling hard. That is why I am asking for help.

He is a loving husband to his wife, Laura, and devoted father to his 7-year old daughter Katherine. Jeff is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet, who always goes out of his way to help others first.A few months ago, Jeff was diagnosed with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a fast acting cancer that grows in the liver and the spleen and causes unbearably high fevers. He has been relentlessly fighting this horrible disease, but unfortunately the cancer has become resistant to the chemotherapy. His family has consulted with some of the top doctors in Seattle, and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) hospital is recommending a treatment that will help extend Jeff?ôs life and hopefully ease some of his symptoms.Jeff?ôs biggest desire and wish is to spend as much time with his family as he can. Since Jeff won?ôt be able to work full time and Laura will have her hands full helping Jeff and taking care of Katherine, this fundraiser is to help cover living expenses for Jeff, Laura and Katherine as they make an abrupt move to lovely, but expensive Seattle, as well as ease the family?ôs financial burdens in the months to come, especially with all the medical bills.Please consider making a donation to this beautiful family. Jeff has so much more life to live with his family and goodness to spread through the community.?For updates on Jeff, Laura will post about Jeff?ôs health journey here: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jeffreymcknightYou can also follow the McKnight Lab twitter to support the lab and get updates from Jeff himself: https://twitter.com/mcknightlab_uo?lang=enRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,Katherine's Transplant Fund,"Created February 1, 2020","Medical, Illness & Healing","$200,000 ","$227,546 ",115,1.8K,85,"For the past ten years, I (Russell) have watched my wife Katherine battle a rare genetic disorder. It has affected her connective tissues, her autonomic?nervous system, and multiple organ systems in her body.Despite her doctor's best efforts, Katherine's condition has deteriorated. Last year, she was diagnosed with intestinal failure. Since September of last year, her only source of nutrition and fluid has been through a central line to her heart. She has also continued to receive bimonthly infusions of immunoglobulin that help to keep her disease from progressing further. Katherine is currently being treated by some of the best gastrointestinal? doctors in the world, and has been recommended for intestinal transplant.Though we are thankful for these life-saving interventions, they present a constant risk of complications. She has had multiple hospitalizations over the past few months, and had three central lines replaced due to infection.As Katherine?ôs illness has progressed, she has lost the ability to drive, and struggles to complete many simple daily tasks on her own. Our 11-year old has also begun to show symptoms of the same disease, and has lost the ability to walk. Out of necessity, I have become a full-time caretaker for our family. This has been very difficult for us?financially.Katherine?ôs IVig treatments are $12,000.00 per month. Her TPN is $6,500.00 per month. Her IV fluids are $2,700.00 per month. The transplant her physicians have recommended would cost $2 million dollars.? Medicare/Medicaid won?ôt approve many of the treatments Katherine?ôs doctors have prescribed for her. When they do approve treatments, they only pay a fraction of the cost, which would leave us owing hundreds of thousands of dollars.A private health plan would cover the majority of these expenses, but the monthly premiums for a plan like this are upwards of $2000.00 per month. In order for Katherine to be listed for transplant, we will have to obtain one of these plans. Katherine's transplant team has advised us to start fundraising for those expenses not covered by insurance. These funds will help us cover deductibles, the cost of traveling to and from D.C. for appointments, housing near the hospital during her 6-month recovery, and living expenses while I serve as her full-time caretaker.??We thank you for your help and kindness. If you can't help us financially, please also consider praying for Katherine?ôs doctors to have wisdom, and that our two children would be comforted as they deal with so many challenging situations.??Russell BergerRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While at the ER, further tests were done to find the cause of her pain, and to everyone's unpleasant surprise it was found that her cancer had spread to her liver and lungs.??Giulianna is beautiful woman who had a successful career in modeling and desired a family with kids more than anything.? She became a mother at an early age and later in life, in recent years, she had two more beautiful children. After a series of life events, Juju ended up having to raise her three kids by herself.? In spite of her situation, she assumed her challenge as a new single mom of three with strength, grace, and love. Giulianna considers her kids as her greatest achievement and biggest blessings; these are Cedric (17), Gianna (3), and Cruz (1). Juju is a natural nurturer, a dedicated mother, a loyal friend, with a happy and very sweet personality... we often say, she ""doesn't have a bad bone in her body""! Guiliana's source of strength through all her challenges has been grounded in her strong belief in Jesus as her Lord and Savior and now her Healer.?Giulianna's situation is aggravated due to the fact that she does not receive any financial help and had to stop working to continue raising her youngest children.

We've launched The Herbfarm's Patreon page? so you can contribute monthly until the COVID-19 crisis ends. There are also great rewards there too.Why does each meal cost $25? Due to the infectiousness of COVID-19 and risks to medical caregivers, the meals must be individually boxed. The hospitals are not accepting ""family style"" shared dishes. Furthermore, as personal protection equipment (PPE) is limited, caregivers must spend hours in protective gear without eating. When they finally get a break and get to remove the gear, they are dehydrated and hungry. Our full course meals meet their immediate needs and help them feel supported by our community.Who are the volunteers and what do they do? Carl Coryell-Martin and Patrick Halstead came up with the idea and worked with Ron and Carrie at The Herbfarm to jumpstart meal delivery. They along with other team members are connecting with hospitals and managing food delivery.What if my kids just want to walk The Herbfarm's pigs, Basil and Borage??Check out The Herbfarm's Patreon page, the $100 monthly contribution level allows just that!Chef Chris Weber of The Herbfarm talking about pivoting the restaurant's operations to serve hundreds of boxed meals each day to doctors and nurses on the front lines of COVID19###################Read more?GoFundMe GuaranteeOnly donations on our platform are protected by the GoFundMe Guarantee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On January 13, 2020, Juan was involved in a bicycle accident that?îdespite wearing a helmet and protective gear?îleft him with a serious type of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) known as Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI). He also suffered a fractured clavicle and spinal fracture.?And as many of you fellow musicians and artists understand, there is no paid time off or sick time for this type of work. The journey Juan and his family are about to embark on is a marathon, not a sprint; it is a long road and we want to be able to tap some of the best and most passionate medical professionals who are experts on TBI patients and their potential for recovery.? Physical, occupational and cognitive therapies are just some of what we'll need to pay for in the coming weeks and months. In-patient care and therapy, special medical equipment and assistance are other expenses we anticipate in the longer term. And while we help Juan focus on recovering, he will not be able to work but of course the goal is to get him back to playing music, and talking pedals on Pedals and Effects? with his partner in crime, Nick. Because the world needs Juan on bass just as much as Juan needs to play bass.??More about Diffuse Axonal InjuryNeurologists have a saying, ""Once you've seen one DAI patient, you've seen one DAI patient,"" which means there aren't any two cases that are alike and the outcomes vary to the point where doctors are hesitant to offer an exact prognosis. Which means we're ready to take on the challenge and offer Juan every opportunity for him and his brain to heal. And we need your help.While the outcome is uncertain, Juan's family, friends and fellow musicians all agree that we must spend the better part of the next year offering him every single opportunity and resource we can so he can beat this and come back stronger than ever. We have to advocate for him and be proactive with his care and treatments because - if you've ever had a prolonged experience in the healthcare system in the U.S. - you've experienced the lack of initiative that is so prevalent. If we want Juan to have the best chance at recovery, we have to draft that plan and get the resources ourselves.? ?We hope you'll be part of his road to recovery - any small donation helps, and we will post regular updates here and on his social channels so you're able to follow his progress.?Thank you, thank you, thank you.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On March 5, 2020 Gregg checked himself into St. Joseph's Providence Hospital Burbank with serious Covid-19 symptoms.? He was the hospital's first Covid-19 patient, or ""Patient Zero"" as they call him.? Two days later, under heavy sedation and paralytic drugs, the doctors intubated him- around day 10 doing a tracheostomy- and he continued to be on a ventilator for 31 days.??? During that time his body became septic; his kidneys failed and he was put on CRRT dialysis; his blood pressure plummeted and he needed medications to divert his blood-flow to his major organs for survival, leaving his hands and feet starving for circulation; he spiked fevers and was covered in ice; his lungs collapsed 4 times and chest tubes were inserted; and he developed secondary infections that are common in hospital environments.? He had a 1% chance of surviving.? The doctors and nursing staff had to always remain 3 steps ahead of any potential disasters because to enter his room took about 15 minutes for them to gear up in their hazmat attire.? Gregg knocked on death's door, but said ""F#$% NO!? I'm not coming in!!!Throughout this time his ""village"" prayed for him, toasted him nightly with tequila- his favorite, meditated, danced and supported him in unmeasurable ways.? His care team at the hospital- an incredible group of smart, talented, caring individuals- did everything in their power to bring him through.? THANK YOU seems inadequate a word to express the gratitude that Gregg and his family feel for all of you.?Gregg moved to acute rehab on April 24 (hospital day 50) and now begins the very long process of rebuilding his body.? He's relearning how to walk, perform daily activities, and rebuilding his strength so that he can head back home to AJ, Bear, family and friends.? ?Until now we have focused our communications on Gregg living and surviving this deadly virus and did not share the severity of injury to his hands and toes.? The sustained lack of circulation to his extremities caused his fingers and toes to turn black, similar to a frostbite injury.? This caused permanent damage and unfortunately once he is released from acute rehab, he will be looking at additional surgeries for amputation, prostheses and of course more physical/occupational therapy as he learns to navigate this new world.? For someone as active as Gregg, this of course is life-changing, but with the right doctors, equipment and support, we know he will tackle this next challenge- AND he will be back skiing, enjoying tequila, and causing his usual raucous-? thanks to your generosity and spirit!? In the meantime, he'll need upgrades in his house to accommodate his new hands and help facilitate movement.? He'll also need 24-hour assistance in the beginning. I know we are all struggling during this time, but these home renovations, doctors' bills, etc. add up, so any additional financial support to ease the future financial strain is more than greatly appreciated.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every day the Black community is witnessing their people being brutalized to death, filmed, publicly degraded, debated about; our safety being dehumanized in real-time, on the news, online, and in social circumstances. These daily recurrences which are supposed to be our daily life are extremely re-traumatizing and triggering. The toll that this race war is having on the mental health and emotional well being of Black folks is denigrating our stability and sense of safety. The goal is to address the lack of Black therapy resources, advocacy, and mental health support in the Vancouver Lower Mainland ???land of the Coast Salish peoples?ìS·∏µwxÃ±w√∫7mesh (Squamish), St√≥:l? and S?l?√≠lw?ta?/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) and x ∑m?Œ∏k ∑?y??m (Musqueam) Nations.There needs to be serious focus redirected towards creating safety networks for Black folks struggling with mental health. Racial trauma is one of the biggest threats to the Black community; physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.I am starting a crowdfunding campaign to support mental health initiatives for Black folks in Vancouver through advocacy + Black-led healing.Vancouver Black Therapy & Advocacy Fund is a not-for-profit initiative that aims to raise funds to make mental health support more accessible to Black community members in the Lower Mainland. This fundraiser was created with the understanding of the disparity of access for Black mental health resources; our goal is to connect members with accredited and recommended local Black counselors and therapists. It is important to address the potential barriers that may exist within our communities in order to make sustainable change. Since there are mostly Hegemonic non-Black therapists in Vancouver without anti-oppression training, it can be alienating and unhealthy for Black communities to be seeking solace and support with non-Black therapists. This is an open call for donations and advocacy for Black therapists to connect with Black folks in need of therapy.??The Goal:Aiming to raise $20,000+ in order to offer therapy funds to 10 +? Black folks, priority to refugees, low income, Disabled, LGBTQIA+ folks, with 12-15 hours of therapy sessions for FREE, funded by the donations. Advocacy services will also be available for the recipients.???UPDATED Goal:Thank you for helping us surpass our original goal. We are still asking for donations to reach our current goal of $200,000. We have already started the process of connecting licensed professionals in the Lower Mainland with 25 selected recipients who applied during the intake period in June. These recipients are currently being provided with free therapy for 5 months, encompassing a total of 20 sessions each.The intake period is closed for now and we are not processing additional applications for the moment. Thank you to people who reached out via the public intake form that was posted through this GoFundMe as well as through social media callouts. We acknowledge the high amount of demand and the need for an ongoing program. We commit to redistributing time and resources to make care work accessible to the Black community in Vancouver; working towards this kind of access is key to our collective healing. We envision healing that is affordable, flexible, and that prioritizes those who often are invisibilized or endangered in other spaces. As somatics practitioner and BLM activist Prentis Hemphill says, ""Healing justice is active intervention in which we transform the lived experience of Blackness in our world."" We want to offer more than temporary relief, we want to offer healing and tools that can be carried forward and into life. We are deeply interested in growing through the complexity of communal healing, and this fund will enable us to manifest what is urgently required to counter individualistic therapeutic models of whiteness, which promote false ideas of the self as an independent agent and do not address or understand racial trauma.We will re-evaluate the program as it evolves to determine how to best allocate the remainder of the funds. Given that this program is in its nascent stage, we want to provide ongoing care and not the stretch numbers right away as we hope this can become an ongoing program. For now, the remainder of the funds will be reserved as contingency for the next intake rounds. Our hope is that we can raise enough funds to allow for a second intake round in the near future as there is a great demand for access to these resources.? We have just launched our monthly donation program, and you can sign up through here: https://donate-can.keela.co/donation-form20This started as a fund being managed by one person, myself, and to address the increase in demand, I am gathering a team to support me and the newly incorporated non-profit foundation with admin, communications, and management.?Every future intake period will be announced through the website, GoFundMe updates, social media and our mailing list: http://vancouverblacktherapyfoundation.com/pages/subscribe.html???UPDATED Budget Breakdown (September 2020)??ãFor the sake of transparency, we will provide a high-level overview of our operations: we have allocated about $100,000 to pay for 20 therapy sessions for 25 people over the next few months. It is important to us that recipients receive these sessions at no charge to them, so the sessions can be accessed long term, with as few barriers as possible. We are planning on covering 20 more people in the next year, for which we want to allocate another $80,000. Our intention is to spend less than 10% of our budget on operational and administrative costs to get the non-profit started and running. We are choosing to invest some funds into operations to lay the groundwork for the VBT&AF to ensure that we will be able to have a strong and sustainable future.??Black Therapy Recipients:Barrier-free mental health access, Although, priority will be given to?immigrants, refugees, disabled & LGBTQIA+ folks., all Black folks are encouraged to apply. Recipients will be non-disclosed. The public intake form was posted through this GoFundMe as well as through social media callouts. The intake period is now closed.?At this time, this fund is exclusive to the Lower Mainland of Vancouver since there is a lack of therapy services for Black folks specifically. However, we will make exceptions for requests outside of this area if you are lacking resources in your area.

We are writing to you from the GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre in Vancouver where John was transferred to last week. It is hard to believe it has been over 2 months since our lives changed course when John had a low speed motorcycle crash during a week-long camping trip across Vancouver Island. John went off the road near Kathleen Lake as he was headed to Port Alice. An airlift by ambulance brought John to Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). The outcome of this accident has unfortunately been disproportionate to the event, with the result being paralysis at ?úC3??(in his neck). Even after much progress in rehab, John still has very limited use of his arms and legs.Now that we are here, the rehab team have started to discuss goals for life after the hospital for us. Things will move fast and our goals are clear ??getting John home to be with our girls Ila and Maya and for him to continue to make a contribution through meaningful work and volunteering.We want to express our gratitude to everyone who continues to support us through the recovery process. We feel the love and support every day through your messages and thoughts. Thank you all! It is immensely helpful. All of your offers for help have been so appreciated and to this point there has not always been a lot of practical things where we needed help, particularly given that many of you are located around the world. The doctors, the health care team and peer support members here at Vancouver General and the GF Strong Rehab Centre have detailed what will be required for John to live at home safely with the family. It is going to take a lot of rehab work and it is going to take a lot of specialized equipment and supplies to do this successfully. The requirements are significant and must stretch over many years including equipment, home renovations and ongoing home care and unfortunately the funds available through insurance are limited. We have been encouraged to start a fundraising effort to assist with acquiring the equipment and home modifications needed for the next phase of life - John 2.0. We have already identified the highest priority items needed for John to get home. The Phase 1 ?úminimum viable product??(a software joke) includes items such as a bed, ventilator, automatic doors, a lift for moving John from bed to chair, a van to get around, a ramp to enter the house and of course, a power wheelchair. Phase 2 would include some longer-term home renovations such as accessible bathroom, ceiling lift and an outdoor covered chair lift. We won?ôt know what those requirements are until we have more time in rehab and get home to see how the house needs to be adapted.The initial cost estimates for Phase 1 equipment could reach close to $200,000:Bed? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?$6K-12KVentilator? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?$15-20KAutomatic doors? ? ? $16-20K Manual lift? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?$4KVan? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?$60-80KRamp? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?TBD Power wheelchair? ?$40-50KTotal? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?$141k - $186kThere will be other adaptive equipment we will likely need to support John at work as well, which we will discover in time.We have a Caring Bridge website that provides progress updates, some fun photos and even a video of John driving his wheelchair!

91,Help Adeline Conquer COVID,"Created August 10, 2020","Medical, Illness & Healing","$150,000 ","$198,031 ",3.8K,19.5K,3.8K,"Adeline, an OB/GYN resident physician, was starting her second year of residency in Texas when she got sick. On July 8th Adeline went into work for her 12 hour shift in the ER. While she mostly works delivering babies, she was doing a rotation in the ER, treating COVID patients. That morning she went into work feeling well and excited to see patients, but by the evening she began to feel under the weather. What started as intense flu-like symptoms escalated within the week to a hospital stay. Adeline spent the next few weeks battling COVID and was treated with several different respiratory therapies and put on dozens of drugs. When there was no positive response to these methods of treatment Adeline decided to begin an experimental drug trial. However, before we could see if this new drug was effective, her lungs could no longer support her. On August 3rd Adeline was intubated and placed on a ventilator. That night her vitals were unstable and the doctors said that she was not responding well to the ventilator. After consulting with our parents, the doctors took the last remaining step available. At 1am on August 4th Adeline was placed on ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The catheters used in the ECMO machine involved an invasive procedure to place them in her femoral artery. The ventilator opens her lungs through positive pressure, while the ECMO machine oxygenates her blood. This leaves Adeline?ôs lungs with the only task of healing themselves. It is projected that Adeline will be on the ventilator and ECMO for at least 6-8 weeks. Since we are from Syracuse, NY, our parents have had to travel back and forth to be there for Adeline and continue to support our family. While our Dad?ôs job can be done virtually, our Mom?ôs cannot and therefore she cannot work. In addition, our Mom helps to take care of our 91 year old grandmother, the responsibility of which has now fallen on us. When Adeline gets off life support, she will need physical, respiratory, and occupational therapy to regain her strength and mobility. At this time, we do not know how long a full recovery will take or when she will be able to return to work.Donations made to Adeline?ôs cause will go toward medical expenses, her bills, travel expenses, and to support the family while we navigate this difficult time.We want everyone to know that Adeline is a fighter. She is determined and has set her mind to surviving this virus. As she fights everyday for her life, we need to stay strong for her on the home front. So much love and support has been shown to our family and from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you.Addendum: Maureen Fagan, the organizer of this GoFundMe, is Dr. Adeline Fagan's sister. Any funds withdrawn from this GoFundMe will be deposited into Adeline's account and will be used accordingly for the purposes stated above. Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I?ôm Ben, 37, I have cystic fibrosis, and without your support I?ôll have 3 months to live with bronchiolitis obliterans destroying my lungs.Imagine the joy I felt when I received a life-saving lung transplant last year. I?ôd be given years of my life back with my wife and two young children, Max, 6 and Ivy, 3. I was healing.But after perfect surgery, coming off ECMO, life support, and alive with new lungs the hospital made a catastrophic miscalculation with my anti-rejection medication which caused my body to attack the lungs. I?ôd had my new lungs for only 5 weeks.Now, I need new lungs. I am in chronic lung allograft dysfunction, rejection, and have been given 3 months to live.I am bed bound, oxygen dependent and on palliative care, dying in front of my children. I can?ôt walk to the toilet, never mind getting to my son?ôs football practice or playing with my daughter.?We were then dealt another devastating blow. Even though the NHS has admitted, on record, that they are culpable for my failing lungs, the board rejected my appeal for another transplant.My ever-resilient wife, Daisy, is now facing the reality of becoming a widow in her 30s and leaving Max and Ivy a whole lifetime to miss their father.But a professor in Switzerland has given us hope.An expert in the pulmonary transplant field studied my case and concluded she would see no problem in a second transplant. She?ôs performed second transplants on patients before, with great success. I have explored every option in my own country to the very highest level. My last hope is travelling to Geneva.I will need to take up residency in Geneva in order to be added to their transplant list. Geneva is expensive. I need to fund accommodation, health insurance, post-surgery care and travel. I'm forced to break up my young family, for the limited time I am in Geneva having the surgery and recovering. To cut down on costs, I?ôll need to leave my wife Daisy and my two children behind and go accompanied by my mum, who is 72, on the basis that two can live more cheaply than four.This is my last chance to see my children grow up, meet their first boyfriend/girlfriend, see them flourish and deliver that proud speech on their wedding day. As a couple, Daisy and I have spent the last few weeks talking to Max about the fact that his Daddy is dying. Imagine trying to tell your 6-year-old you might not be there for Christmas.?I just don?ôt have the financial resources to do all of this alone and I now rely on the kindness of friends & strangers.You would be saving my life, giving me years with my beautiful wife, Daisy, my son Max, who is passionate about football, and Ivy, who?ôs going through a pink glitter unicorn stage right now.I want them to know that I explored every possible avenue to stay with them for as long as I can - like any parent would.?Thank you so much for any support you can give me.Ben?ôs story so far:My journey with cystic fibrosis starts at birth in 1983; just 2 years after my sister passed away. She was 16. She would be 55 now. My mum has had this chronic illness in her life for 55 years watching two children suffer at the hands of this horrible life-limiting disease.I spent my adult years being looked after very well at St James Hospital in Leeds, but as I grew into my 30s I developed diabetes and my lungs started to deteriorate.I married my wonderful wife in 2012, and we set about the task of creating a family. Unfortunately for us, our only option was via IVF, with genetic testing and difficult sperm retrieval. But after two attempts we were blessed with Max, who is now 6 and then three years later, on our fourth round of IVF, we welcomed our daughter Ivy into the world.?In 2016 I spent 25 weeks out of 52 in St James??hospital, with a 2 year old, a marriage and a business to run; life was testing to say the least - little did I know just how difficult it was going to become.When Ivy was born my life was very typical of a CFer. I had over 4 hours of physio a day, and nebulizers, and I was taking over 60 pills a day, struggling through overwhelming tiredness while being a Dad to two little ones.In December 2017 I became life-threateningly unwell and started compassionate use of the new modifying CF drugs, Orkambi, which at first saw great results for me for 5 months. I then sadly had to come off them due to side effects.?Fast forward to February 2019 - near death, then a miracle: I caught swine flu, having religiously had my flu jab every year, which sent me in a downward spiral of 12 weeks in St James??Hospital hurtling towards death. A last minute urgent lung transplant saved my life.But my family?ôs joy was short lived. In the fifth week post transplant, there was a serious miscalculation with my anti-rejection drug levels. I was sent into severe acute rejection. This was all admitted and apologised for by the hospital. But it was too late.This acute rejection set off a domino effect of problems.

Aaron worked hard to build up a tutoring business and worked long hours because he loves to teach and wanted his family to have the best.Along with his tutoring center, Aaron also spent the last two school years teaching math at Village Christian School. While there, he would participate in faculty-student basketball games (where he subsequently got injured), freshman retreats, and pep rallies.

This is a memorial fund set up by close friends of Ben Kelly. We want to support his wife Katie during this tragic time by covering all burial expenses and all of her living expenses for the foreseeable future. This is our tangible way of carrying on Ben's legacy of love and generosity.?------------ A Tribute--------------How do you distill the essence of a person?ôs life into a few sentences? Somehow tying words together in a way that simultaneously honors them, grieves their loss and also helps you cope with the shock and pain you feel knowing that they aren?ôt in this world anymore, feels impossible. But I have to try - I?ôm not sure of any other way to process this kind of freak, tragic accident. It feels like the ultimate form of betrayal to fall victim to the one thing a surfer recognizes and fears as a possibility. We sign the proverbial liability waiver every time we paddle out, but the thought of such a horrific event is dismissed as an extreme rarity. Those thoughts are quickly overshadowed by the joy and refreshment that comes from surfing and getting a good wave, and so we still choose to paddle out. Ironic that in all of this, the least I remember about him was how he surfed or even his style. Don?ôt get me wrong - he was a really good surfer. I can still picture his frothing face after getting a nugget. I highly doubt he?ôd care to be remembered for that though. The most memorable thing about Ben was his unashamed, unrelenting passion for his faith and his relationship with Jesus. I don?ôt say this to somehow selfishly reassure myself or others that he?ôs passed on to Heaven. I don?ôt have to wonder whether he knew Jesus, or whether his faith was secure. It was. Everybody knew it. He truly lived his faith out. In nearly every conversation I ever had with him, he tied God and the redeeming love of Jesus into it.?He loved his wife unequivocally. He was stoked out of his mind whenever she?ôd surf and he was so proud of her. Adventure and travel was a huge part of their lives. They were dreamers, go-getters. Ben had an entrepreneurial spirit and drive that is so rare. He had such a special bond with her and it was evidenced by their sincerity and kindness to one another and their passion for serving others like Jesus. They were hospitable and fun, always down for a game night or a BBQ with anyone they knew.?We're remembering: all those dawn patrols. Strike missions up and down the coast. Watching surf movies. Talking about shaping. Drinking cold IPAs and napping in the sun post-surf. His passion for a good board game.?The way he talked so fast when he was stoked. How passionate he would get during a game of Spikeball. How he would read tax laws for fun. How much he loved talking about Jesus??teachings and encouraged everyone to love Jesus more too.?He was a good, godly, humble man who deserved many, many more laps around the sun and many more good waves. We all miss you, Ben.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A gifted guitarist and musician, he started playing guitar at the age of 12, and some of his greatest joys were playing for Harley and sharing his great love of music with her. He cultivated an extensive record collection which he was in the process of listening to alphabetically with Allie and Harley. Seppe was the Ficerai family cultural influencer, starting the annual tradition of listening to Girl Talk remixes while decorating the Christmas Tree and introducing his family to The OC, Quentin Terentino films, Led Zeppelin, Bon Iver and classic rock (influenced by his dad), Kurt Vonnegut and Michael Chabon novels, the latest edgy stand-up comedians, and so much more.?Seppe had a spontaneous and adventurous spirit. He loved riding his Harley Davidson and recently completed a scenic bike trip from Austin, TX to Boulder, CO and Taos, NM to visit friends. Seppe also enjoyed skydiving and was instrumental in convincing his siblings to try the experience as well (and they are glad that they did). He spent time outdoors with his dog Topo, and enjoyed playing sports of all kinds, particularly his local soccer league with Allie. He was a lifelong Steelers fan, just like his dad, and was never shy about being the loudest in the crowd.Seppe took after his mom and enjoyed perfecting his cooking and barbecue skills, often? devoting hours, sometimes entire days, to preparing meals for the enjoyment of his family and friends. The whole Ficerai family spent Independence Day 2019 together in Austin, and Seppe stayed up all night to monitor his smoked brisket, foregoing sleep and shower to ensure that the family shared an unforgettable and delicious meal together. That was Seppe: incredibly generous, endlessly compassionate, and always willing to do whatever he could for others. During this particular visit, countless friends stopped by the house, and the Ficerai family watched as each and every visitor was greeted with open arms and a plate of food, in true Seppe fashion. He had inimitable charisma and an uncanny ability to make people laugh, especially with pranks, jokes and his memorable alter egos like The Raptor, Sabeachy, and an assortment of fake names he gave to his high school teachers. He was happy to be weird, often making requests of his mom like overalls for Christmas and affectionately referring to his loved ones by inexplicable pet names (such as ?úmollusk??. We will always remember Seppe?ôs humor and boisterous laugh.?Seppe carried on this silly time with his daughter Harley, who inherited his zaniness, creativity and ability to bring joy to others. He loved Allie and Harley with all of his heart and was most proud to be a father. He often spoke of how lucky he was that Harley was the coolest kid, and he treasured being able to share his interests with her. He was so excited to welcome a second child with Allie, whom he lovingly described as an amazing mother, partner and support system for him, which was obvious to anyone who spent even a brief time together with them. Seppe took care of his family in every way: he was responsible, loyal and present, and he affectionately said he would do anything for ?úhis girls.?ùSeppe?ôs compassion, life experiences and empathy led him to work in the recovery community. He cofounded Chuck and Joe?ôs Sober Living alongside his best friend Charlie Moffet to provide safe homes created for men in recovery, by men in recovery. He has also contributed to the recovery community through his work at Solstice Recovery Foundation, where he helped hundreds of other young men working on their recovery from drug addiction with his close friends Tara and Cole Shiflet. Seppe also inspired and partnered with his parents, Joe and Chico, in their ?úSix Steps to Sanity??ministry to help the families of children struggling with addiction, which will continue in his memory.Seppe knew how much his family and friends loved him and that we never stopped believing in him and in his recovery. He showed tremendous progress in and dedication to his sobriety since Allie and Harley came into his life nearly four years ago and until his sudden passing.

For almost 20 years, not only did Duncan dedicate himself to serving the Toronto community as a first responder, he became a husband to the love of his life and a loving and adoring father to two beautiful girls; Willow 8, and Marigold 4. Like most of us, until 2 years ago Duncan was living a joyful and hectic life, balancing work and family. Despite feeling tired and stressed like all parents, he was thankful for the life he lived. Duncan was always an upbeat and hardworking firefighter, respecting the role he played in his community, viewing his career as a firefighter, a privilege more than a job - just like his father. Very suddenly, in the summer of 2018,? Duncan began experiencing relentless heartburn type sensations and difficulty swallowing. When told it would take weeks to get an exam done, Duncan persisted and went to his Doctor?ôs office at opening and demanded to be examined more thoroughly??likely knowing deep down that it was more serious than he wished. Unfortunately,? he was right.? Duncan was given the shocking news that he had? stage-4 gastro-esophageal cancer.Duncan immediately began treatment, and for the past two years had been battling the fight of his life with positivity and braveness, popping into the firehall between chemo treatments to make sure his other ?úfamily??knew he was well and fighting with everything he had.? Unfortunately, while Duncan was fighting his own battle, he had to say goodbye to his father who succumbed to prostate cancer just last year on January 30th, 2019.

The type of pain and uncertainty facing Duncan's family must be met with support and empathy from us.?Unfortunately, even though Duncan dedicated his entire career to firefighting and as a first responder in his community, he has fallen short of the presumptive cancer legislation for firefighters by 5 years. A coverage that would ensure his wife and children be taken care of financially in the event of his death.?

She leaves behind a loving husband, Manuel Romero, and two wonderful children, Cati (7) and Max (5) who will miss her every day.? She also leaves behind all of us whose lives she made better by being in it - all of us who are now left wondering how this could possibly be.? What Layla cared most about was education, and so we thought one small thing we could do was to start a college fund for her two young children. Though small in stature, Layla was a giant of a woman.? Fiercely loyal.? Whip smart. Unwaveringly committed.? Justice driven. Incredible mother. Dedicated wife.? Words cannot do justice to the impact that she had on those she worked with and loved.? The world lost one of its best today, but it remains a better place because of her.??Layla's StoryThough only 47 years old, she accomplished more than most of us ever will.? Her story is an incredible one that will always be remembered.? Born in Boyle Heights to a single mother, Layla had to grow up fast.? Her mother was diagnosed with MS when Layla was in elementary school.? She took on adult responsibilities as she navigated her way through everything from her mother?ôs doctors appointments to helping to bathe her.? In middle school, a teacher saw tremendous potential in Layla and helped her apply to A Better Chance, which placed her in an elite boarding high school in Colorado Springs, CO.? She went on to attend Columbia University and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, excelling at both institutions. She then decided to join Teach for America and was placed as a first grade teacher in Compton, CA.? People watched her classroom in amazement as she expertly maneuvered the kids through the instructional day with the deftness of a veteran.? It made her an immediate favorite amongst students, families and the staff at Mayo Elementary where she was asked, as a new teacher, to serve on the Leadership Team.Layla left the classroom to have a broader impact in education and was hired to ?run ?úCompton Teaching Fellows??, a program of The New Teacher Project (TNTP) with the Compton Unified School District.? As with everything in her life, she was amazing at her job and quickly won the respect of Randy Ward, the then-State appointed Superintendent who was a tough critic by any measure. ?For the next two decades she moved into increasingly challenging roles at TNTP, helping to lead the organization to become what it is today. ?She gained broad based respect as someone who spoke directly, could never be rattled, solved the most complex problems in practical ways and simply got things done.A few years ago, Layla was recruited to become the founding CEO of EdLOC, a national organization focused on developing and supporting leaders of color to drive the education reform movement.? Of course, she has built a tremendous new organization and gained legions of new fans and supporters.? Layla?ôs goal for her work in education has always been clear.? She wanted to ensure that the world became a place where kids who looked like her would be able to excel without having to have the lucky breaks she did.? She wanted to create a world in which kids like her would be able to enter a school or workplace and feel like they belonged, set up for success, instead of being viewed with skepticism.Somehow, between all of her incredible work accomplishments, Layla managed to run for and win a position on the Whittier School Board and serve on the boards of various nonprofit organizations.But most importantly, Layla built an amazing family with her husband, Manuel Romero.? ?úBear??and ?úBunny?? ?as they affectionately referred to each other, were soulmates from the start.? The reserved and private Layla was balanced out perfectly by Manuel, the gregarious extrovert.? The two of them built a wonderful family including their brilliant, talented daughter Catarina Rose (Cati, 7) and their charming and loving son Maximiliano Noe (Max, 5).? Layla was the mother who was at every single school event, chaperoning every field trip, and making sure her kids always had the best of everything. That was Layla in a nutshell.? This beautiful family was the kind of bright light that our world needs today.Michelle, Liz and AriRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her pain and symptoms were not taken seriously until she was unable to breathe unassisted. She spent over 30 days on a ventilator, but by the time her symptoms improved, her body had simply endured too much.This is a story that is all too familiar for Black women. While Covid 19 ultimately took her life, institutional racism played a significant role in Rana¬¥s death.Rana was a writer and a middle school teacher. She was a profound advocate for ending institutionalized racism and combating the disparities and inequalities faced by minorities and the LGBTQ+ community. More than anything else, she believed in the power of our youth, of the countless black and brown teenagers our society dismisses, demoralizes, and discards. She was a hardcore geek and an incredible storyteller, delighting her readers with vivid, earnest glimpses into her life and the neighborhood that raised her.

This marks a spike of over 2,200 cases in 12 days on Navajo.? Numbers are also on the rise on the Hopi Reservation, and both tribal governments have placed their communities in lockdown again. Our relief effort is the primary relief effort providing assistance on both reservations.? We have already deployed roughly $6 million in direct relief in both communities, which has us nearing depletion of existing GoFundMe donations.? We need a second wave of donations to help us meet the second wave--tsunami, really--of COVID that is inundating our communities.? To date, the Relief Fund has raised over $6 million, and has spent almost all of that on bringing vital resources to Navajo and Hopi communities to help shield them from COVID. The team and a legion of hundreds of Navajo and Hopi volunteers all over the two nations has provided food and water to over 46,000 households (each roughly averaging 4 persons per household, and amounting to over 186,000 people served?îwhich is more than the combined population of the Navajo and Hopi Reservations) in 335 distributions in over 530 Navajo communities and Hopi Villages.

The Navajo Nation and Hopi Reservation are extreme food deserts with only 14 grocery stores on the two reservations to serve some 180,000 people who live in a territory larger than West Virginia, or larger than the combined area of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.? These communities have high numbers of elderly, diabetic, asthmatic, and cancer-afflicted (i.e., high risk) individuals.? One-third of the people living on these two reservations do not have running water, and another third don't have electricity.? These communities could be devastated by COVID-19. ?Our relief effort prioritizes those at highest risk of complications if they contract COVID, and the most vulnerable:? the elderly, immunocompromised, mobility impaired, and families with children but inadequate income (roughly half of the people living on the two reservations are unemployed; 45.5 percent of Navajo families with children live in poverty, and 14.9 percent live in extreme poverty).? We provide our beneficiaries with food, water, PPE, health supplies, cleaning supplies and other essential items (like toiletries) they need to weather this pandemic.? The need is so great.? Please give if you can. ?Each week since April 12 we have consistently brought $150,000 to $200,000 worth of food, water, PPE, and cleaning supplies to 15 to 20 Navajo and Hopi communities (each Kinship Care Package we hand out consists of 2 weeks??worth of these materials). We have deployed over $4,060,196 in direct purchases of food and over $565,500 in PPE in Navajo and Hopi communities. We are currently in the process of deploying another $800,000 in PPE Kit supplies and 17 tons of coal for an elders heating program and will continue distributing the PPE Kits through the end of February.We sanitize all items before we distribute them, and we have a rigorous health and safety training for all of our staff and volunteers.?

We do not use any of our individual donations through GoFundMe or made through our fiscal sponsor to compensate staff.? We bring our direct relief items by truck to Navajo and Hopi where our teams sanitize them and assemble Kinship Care Packages (include 2 weeks of food, water, PPE, health items, and cleaning supplies) or PPE Kits (include a container of 75-count Clorox wipes, 50-count 3-ply masks, and 8 oz. of gel hand sanitizer).? We distribute our food through contactless drive-thru or home deliveries.? We also provide immediate assistance to COVID-positive families in isolation or COVID-exposed families in quarantine by providing food and Isolation Kits (the Isolation Kits are extensive and include things like vitamins, tissue paper, cough drops, sleeping bags, etc.).We are also helping to stop the spread of COVID-19 on these reservations by engaging some 300 volunteers to sew masks for medical workers and first responders on Navajo and Hopi. We use donated funds to help purchase the fabric for these masks.? Through the masterful coordination of our Super Volunteer and now Logistics Coordinator, Theresa Hatathlie-Delmar, we have facilitated the transfer of some 73,441 masks, surgical gowns, bunny suits, and bootie covers to Navajo and Hopi community members and first responders.?

This marks a spike of over 2,200 cases in 12 days on Navajo.? Numbers are also on the rise on the Hopi Reservation, and both tribal governments have placed their communities in lockdown again. Our relief effort is the primary relief effort providing assistance on both reservations.? We have already deployed roughly $6 million in direct relief in both communities, which has us nearing depletion of existing GoFundMe donations.? We need a second wave of donations to help us meet the second wave--tsunami, really--of COVID that is inundating our communities.? To date, the Relief Fund has raised over $6 million, and has spent almost all of that on bringing vital resources to Navajo and Hopi communities to help shield them from COVID. The team and a legion of hundreds of Navajo and Hopi volunteers all over the two nations has provided food and water to over 46,000 households (each roughly averaging 4 persons per household, and amounting to over 186,000 people served?îwhich is more than the combined population of the Navajo and Hopi Reservations) in 335 distributions in over 530 Navajo communities and Hopi Villages. The Relief Fund currently seeks to raise enough funding to carry Navajo and Hopi families through this second wave, through the cold and flu season, and to the end of the COVID pandemic in these communities. We estimate needing $6.5 million in order to meet that goal, so we have now adjusted our GoFundMe campaign goal to $13 million total. By donating, you will help the most heavily impacted community in the USA.? For $100, you will help a family of four by providing them with 2 weeks??worth of food and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).? For as little as $10, you can help feed a family of 4 for an entire day.? Donate today to the Navajo & Hopi Families COVID-19 Relief Fund. The Navajo Nation and Hopi Reservation are extreme food deserts with only 14 grocery stores on the two reservations to serve some 180,000 people who live in a territory larger than West Virginia, or larger than the combined area of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.? These communities have high numbers of elderly, diabetic, asthmatic, and cancer-afflicted (i.e., high risk) individuals.? One-third of the people living on these two reservations do not have running water, and another third don't have electricity.? These communities could be devastated by COVID-19. ?Our relief effort prioritizes those at highest risk of complications if they contract COVID, and the most vulnerable:? the elderly, immunocompromised, mobility impaired, and families with children but inadequate income (roughly half of the people living on the two reservations are unemployed; 45.5 percent of Navajo families with children live in poverty, and 14.9 percent live in extreme poverty).? We provide our beneficiaries with food, water, PPE, health supplies, cleaning supplies and other essential items (like toiletries) they need to weather this pandemic.? The need is so great.? Please give if you can. ?Each week since April 12 we have consistently brought $150,000 to $200,000 worth of food, water, PPE, and cleaning supplies to 15 to 20 Navajo and Hopi communities (each Kinship Care Package we hand out consists of 2 weeks??worth of these materials). We have deployed over $4,060,196 in direct purchases of food and over $565,500 in PPE in Navajo and Hopi communities. We are currently in the process of deploying another $800,000 in PPE Kit supplies and 17 tons of coal for an elders heating program and will continue distributing the PPE Kits through the end of February.We sanitize all items before we distribute them, and we have a rigorous health and safety training for all of our staff and volunteers.? We are mostly all volunteers with 33 team leaders that each lead a team of 5-8 volunteers in the Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona portions of the Navajo Nation and on Hopi (located in Arizona).? ?Our 6 staff members are compensated through use of grant funding.? We do not use any of our individual donations through GoFundMe or made through our fiscal sponsor to compensate staff.? We bring our direct relief items by truck to Navajo and Hopi where our teams sanitize them and assemble Kinship Care Packages (include 2 weeks of food, water, PPE, health items, and cleaning supplies) or PPE Kits (include a container of 75-count Clorox wipes, 50-count 3-ply masks, and 8 oz. of gel hand sanitizer).? We distribute our food through contactless drive-thru or home deliveries.? We also provide immediate assistance to COVID-positive families in isolation or COVID-exposed families in quarantine by providing food and Isolation Kits (the Isolation Kits are extensive and include things like vitamins, tissue paper, cough drops, sleeping bags, etc.).We are also helping to stop the spread of COVID-19 on these reservations by engaging some 300 volunteers to sew masks for medical workers and first responders on Navajo and Hopi. We use donated funds to help purchase the fabric for these masks.? Through the masterful coordination of our Super Volunteer and now Logistics Coordinator, Theresa Hatathlie-Delmar, we have facilitated the transfer of some 73,441 masks, surgical gowns, bunny suits, and bootie covers to Navajo and Hopi community members and first responders.? We also receive and distribute in-kind donations.? For example, 48,000 cans of water from Jason Momoa and Mananalu, and 8 tons of canned water from Can?ôd Aid.? Through the Airbridge program held in collaboration with Air Serv International (in their first domestic relief operation) we were able to fly over 48,000 pounds of PPE and other relief items to remote Navajo and Hopi communities in July and August.We also use your donations to run a public education campaign urging folks to stay home, socially distance, and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.?

Their beautiful mother, Sundee, fought a long, hard battle in the past year with breast cancer and survived! She continued to work at her job at Ross Dress for Less throughout her treatment as she was the sole provider for her six beautiful and amazing children. ?Due to all the cancer treatments, Sundee didn?ôt have much left in the way of an immune system. Unfortunately and tragically, She contracted the virus that is making the news lately. ( I can?ôt say the name of the virus otherwise fb will delete the post). She fought valiantly until she could not fight any more. She lost her battle on March 16, 2020. She is preceded in death by the father of her children. This has not been an easy road for these kids. They have been through a lot in the past several years. Sundee was an absolutely amazing mom and instilled only the utmost of values in her children. I have never known a group of siblings who stick together and take care of one another as much as these kids do. The oldest three are in college and the youngest three are in high school and middle school. Tyree, the oldest of the family, graduates from college in June and will be trying to secure housing so that he can finish the job of raising his siblings that his mom could not. Please help support this family to get some housing set up and for whatever else the family may need in the coming months. They are still looking into funeral arrangements and a Celebration of Life for Sundee in the future. They are a proud family but they touched so many people?ôs lives that I know many want to help in any way they can. Below, I have posted what Sundee?ôs eldest daughter, Alexis, wrote about her mom when she set up a fundraiser to help the family during her battle with cancer. I could not have described Sundee as eloquently as Alexis did. Please message me or Sundee?ôs sister, Shawnna Loomis-Olsen, on ?Messenger if you would like to help in other ways. Thank you so much!?From Alexis: For those of you who know or have ever crossed paths with our mother, Sundee, it was likely made clear to you immediately how genuine, selfless, courageous, hard-working, and caring this woman is. She is always the first to lend a helping hand to those in need and has consistently remained positive and resilient through the many curve balls life has thrown her way. As a single mother of six children (ages 24, 21, 20, 15, 14, 13), She has made it her highest priority to instill in us all of the amazing and upheld values and morals she possesses, with high hopes that each of us are able to make positive changes and impacts on our friends, family, and community.?Lets help Sundee continue her dreams for her children.

The fire was set at the back of the house, but the damages spread throughout the entire property. This was not an accident. This was arson.This is bigger than just one house. This is about students losing their Jewish home away from home.The UD Chabad Student Board set up this page to start raising money, initiating the love, support and rebuilding even before the Chabad Directors fully processed the loss and figured out the next step forward.This student-led initiative ultimately turned into our official campaign for rebuilding.We, all of us, Rabbi Avremel, Shulie, the Student Board and the Jewish community at UD, feel your embrace and support from around the world. We are so grateful to you and your gift that will rebuild at UD.Thanks to your love, and with the encouragement of our colleagues, layleaders, students and alumni, we are increasing this campaign to $1,000,000 to completely cover the FIRST PHASE of this new home for our students.We can?ôt replace what was. Someone maliciously burned down this sacred space, ?úthe little blue house,??that grew so many magnificent memories for hundreds of students over the last 20+ years!The little blue house means so much to the students who found inspiration, community, connection, and even love there. Yes, many marriages started out by meeting each other at the little blue house.It wasn?ôt fancy, it was well worn, lived in, and much loved. It was theirs, and the students thronged there every Friday night. And now, the little blue house is in ashes. The objects and walls that could tell so many tales about Jewish connection and community are no more. Someone destroyed more than the little blue house. They destroyed the walls that held 20+ years of memories, life, and laughter.The little blue house is gone. As we mourn the memories, we must rebuild to create new ones. Like the fabled phoenix, We must rise up from the ashes, stronger, younger, and bigger to live again.For over 20 years, one hundred students would cram in the little blue house. Together we can give them a place to host double that size. Double the memories, double the space, double the laughter.This is what happens when the entire community comes together with a powerful surge of love, support, and togetherness.In the shadow of the fire, and amongst the ashes, a light of unity will shine brighter and much longer than the fire of destruction.Let?ôs Help Chabad UD Rise Up!-------We wanted to preserve the original plea from this student-led initiative. Here it is below --On Tuesday, August 25, 2020, at around 11 pm a fire was started with intention, at the University of Delaware Chabad. The fire was set at the back of the house, but the damages spread throughout the entire property. Although they tried to salvage what survived, there is not much left. In its entirety, the fire took about three hours to extinguish and while initial estimates put the damages at $75,000 further inspection gave an estimate of $150,00 - $200,000 in damages. No one was present in the home when the fire occurred.?Chabad at UD is a home away from home for many Jewish students at the University of Delaware. Each week they open their doors, for Shabbat dinners and other programs such as holidays, celebrations, and learning opportunities. All of this wouldn't be possible without Rabbi Avremel and Shulie Vogel. Their constant generosity keeps students coming back each week. Rabbi, Shulie, and their three children have created a family at UD and have devoted their lives to bettering the Jewish community on campus.This campaign is being run by the students of Chabad, it is the least we can do to kickstart the larger campaign that will be rolled out shortly. Please consider donating whatever you can to help contribute to fixing the damages caused by the fire. All funds will be given to the Vogel Family to rebuild The Chabad House. The little blue house, which we students called home, will be missed, but it is time to give back and rebuild what we have lost.From all of us - Grace Hollander, Haley Levine, Jessica Ehrlich, Sarah Chalmin, Nikki Matza, Louie Gelb, Alex Beigelman, and alumnae Gabby Taubenfeld, and Ariana Marks -? we thank you for your donations to a cause so close to our hearts!Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Back in the first days of Ground Zero operations, my not-for-profit first operated out of the back of a truck to deliver respirators and other PPEs directly into first responders' hands, as widely documented in foundation and news reports.WTC Ground Zero Relief was Art Science Research Laboratory?ôs emergency response project that provide PPE for uniform services (NYPD, FDNY, PAPD) at the nine month Ground Zero cleanup after 9/11.Bios:Rhonda Roland Shearer, an artist, scholar and award-winning journalist, provided Charles King, Housing Works??longtime director, with original funding and start-up space for Housing Works in 1990 in her art studio, and later started Housing Works Thrift Shop. Shearer is a philanthropist and director of Art Science Research Laboratory, a 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit that she co-founded with her late husband, Harvard professor and scientist, Stephen Jay Gould.Shearer borrowed nearly one million dollars to buy PPE's for 9/11 first responders who also did not have proper safety equipment. Through ASRL, a private family foundation, she later raised millions of dollars to pay the vendor bills for the WTC Ground Zero Relief Project. She is again using borrowed money to secure personal protective equipment for workers responding to the coronavirus pandemic in New York City. ASRL publishes numerous websites including the award-winning iMediaEthics media ethics news website, the NASA Astrobiology Magazine (now just an archive), and the art research website Tout Fait.com. The legendary philanthropist Paul Mellon gave approximately $2 million to originally fund ASRL.??Housing Works is a NYC-based non-profit whose mission is to end the dual crises of homelessness and AIDS through relentless advocacy, the provision of lifesaving services, and entrepreneurial businesses that sustain their efforts.

Det t√§r h√•rt p√• kroppen. Faran med cellgifter √§r ocks√• att man f√∂rr eller senare blir resistent, och d√• tar sjukdomen √∂ver och sedan g√•r det snabbt.Som ni kanske vet hittade man den s√• kallade BRCA2-genen i mina prover, vilket √§r extremt ovanligt. Det √§r en p√• cirka 450 bukspottsk√∂rtelcancerpatienter som har den genen. BRCA2-genen g√∂r att man kan behandla tum√∂ren med en annan behandling √§n cellgifter. Behandlingen heter Olaparib och √§r s√• pass ny att den endast √§r godk√§nd privat i USA, Finland och i vissa europeiska l√§nder (dessv√§rre ing√•r den inte i den standardiserade behandlingen i Sverige √§n). Den kan komma att bli godk√§nd i Sverige ??men det kommer att dr√∂ja och jag har inte den tiden.Min bror har pratat med onkologer i Sverige, Finland, samt en av v√§rldens ledande bukspottsk√∂rtelcancerforskare i USA. Samtliga har uttryckt att de anser att jag snarast b√∂r g√• √∂ver p√• Olaparib-behandling.Problemet √§r att den inte bekostas av landstingsv√•rden i och med att den inte √§r ig√•ng h√§r i Sverige.Ig√•r fick jag det goda beskedet att Aleris Christinakliniken vid Sophiahemmet kommer att ta hand om mig (privat) med denna behandling.

En behandling √§r sex m√•nader l√•ng, och l√•ter kroppen √•terh√§mta sig fr√•n cellgifter samtidigt som den √§r effektiv mot tum√∂ren och spridningen.

The danger with chemotherapy is that sooner or later you?ôre going to grow resistant to it, which would lead to the decease taking over the body and everything moves very quickly from there.As some of you may also know, I was tested positive to having the so called BRCA2-gene, which is extremely rare and is only found in about 1 in 450 people with pancreas cancer. The BRCA2-gene allows the tumor to be treated with a treatment other than chemotherapy. The treatment is called Olaparib and is so new that it?ôs only approved privately in the USA, Finland and in some European countries (unfortunately it is not included in the standard treatment in Sweden yet). It may be approved in Sweden - but it will be delayed, and I do not have that time.My brother has spoken to oncologists in Sweden, Finland, and one of the world's leading pancreatic cancer researchers in the United States. All have expressed that they think I should switch to Olaparib treatment as soon as possible. The problem is that the treatment isn?ôt funded by county council care as it?ôs not up and running here in Sweden. Yesterday I received the good news that Aleris Christina Clinic at Sophia home in Stockholm will be able to help me with the treatment (privately). Relieving as I don?ôt have to travel to get the treatment. A treatment is six months long, and allows the body to recover from cell toxins while being effective against the tumor and against any spread of the tumor. The disadvantage is that a six-month treatment costs about SEK 450,000 and after that I need to continue with further treatments, so this is unfortunately only the beginning. Two treatments cost about SEK 900,000 (approx 90000 USD). My amazing friends have already collected SEK 200,000(20 000 USD), so now we are missing SEK 700,000 (70 000 USD).This is incredibly hard for me to write, but I have no choice. I want to see my daughters, Thea 17 years and Greta 13 years, grow up. I turn to all my friends now because I need help funding this kind of treatment. All contributions, large and small, are welcome.Hugs and love! Annele Hencz Mortimer-Hawkins If you prefer to swish: 0705296802 (Write Annele Foundraiser in the message)PS. If any of you have tips on foundations or other ways / places you can apply for funding, please let us know.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

201,Mallacoota Fires Support Fund,"Created December 31, 2019",Accidents & Emergencies,"$350,000 ","$313,883 ",3.3K,13.6K,3.3K,"Click here to see the video and reality of what is left of Mallacoota the day after the fires.?I am the Niece of Mariska Ascher who is the face of the Mallacoota Fundraising Group. She is currently waiting and preparing to be fighting fires around her home so I have decided to help her, I would continue what she is doing and open a GoFundMe to assist her as she doesn't have energy or focus to be making this herself at the moment... more important things she is dealing with at the moment, I am sure you can understand. All funds raised will be deposited into the bank account of the Mallacoota Fundraising Group.Just to let all know where the donations are going: 1. The funds will be partly for the fire station upgrade to fight future fires as Mariska has informed me that they are surviving with a single truck. The rest who have helped fight the fires is the surrounding fire stations who have come together to help Mallacoota not be burnt to the ground. There is definitely money also needed for them to prepare for any future fires with the increasing heat coming in the next few years. We don't want a repeat of this ever again if we can help it. Remember that these firefighters are volunteers risking their lives to protect everyone else so without them, there would be no Mallacoota or homes saved. Some of what is raised will need to go back to them as they put their lives on hold - one drove 800kms to help without a cent being earnt to risk his life for homes and the land. This is just one example they have gone to to help save what we all love.2. It will also be split across the community accordingly based on how much is raised. I understand everyone wants to help the community and we are doing our best to get this arranged quickly. The money already donated WILL be split and won't go to just one area of Mallacoota. The more money raised, the more people we can help.3. The wildlife are suffering and this money will also go towards the care, maintenance and medical expenses of the wildlife. There are a number of lucky ones which survived the fire but are now suffering extremely painful hands, feet, noses and eyes which remain swollen, charred, blistered and weeping from the flames which can only be described as 3rd degree burns which then produce agonising blisters, and many with broken bones from trying to run for their lives but unable to run fast enough. They need our help more than ever so your donations will also go to the shelter these poor suffering animals are being treated. This has been the location that now famous Patrick Boyle has been taking the koalas he has rescued.A simple comment when donating would suffice if someone wants to have their money go to a specific area rather than split across the whole cause. It will save people having to try and reach out to Mariska herself to move money to the correct area manually. Bank details for those who want to direct transfer are as follows: Mallacoota Fundraising Group Bendigo Bank BSB. 633000ACC. 167799568I hope this helps clear everything up.

A devastating wildfire surrounded the couple's home in the early hours of the morning, and despite the heroic efforts of Chris and Angie, Angie's mother, Peggy, and the couple's 13-year-old son, Wyatt, were killed by the fire. At first, Wyatt was missing and there was hope, but 2 days later he was found in the driver's seat of the family's car with his grandmother Peggy, his dog in his lap and had not survived the Santiam fire. Angie is in critical condition in the burn unit.What we know happened...there were high winds and the power went out and Chris had left to get a generator. Angie awoke to flames surrounding their home. Grandmother Peggy had broken her leg a week earlier and was awaiting surgery. Angie had loaded her mother in the car and by the time she got Wyatt and the animals, the car was surrounded by flames. Knowing it was life and death and there was no way to drive the car out, Angie told her 13 year old son Wyatt and his dog Duke to run. Angie stayed as long as possible to try to get her mother out of the car. but was not successful. She had no choice but to leave her mother, hoping Wyatt would be 10 minutes ahead of her. It was pitch black outside except for flames and smoke and their driveway was very long as was the road back to the main highway.? However, Wyatt did not keep going toward safety, and instead went back to the car and tried to drive his grandmother out of the flames. The road was so hot, it burnt the tires up. He was a heroic boy, trying against all odds to save his grandmother.? All this happened while his father Chris was desperately trying to get back to his family. Blockades had been set up and in desperation he ran the blockades. He found a woman on the road, wearing what looked like a bikini, feet burnt to the bone, unrecognizable. (We later learned the road was so hot she had wrapped her feet with her clothes which had burnt away.) Chris put this woman he did not recognize in the car and said he was sorry but he had to keep going to save his son and wife. Her mouth was black and was not able to speak, but finally whispered ""I am your wife."" After desperate searching, the car was found 2 days later with Wyatt in the driver's seat with his dog in his lap and his grandmother in the car.?Angie survived the fire but suffered full-body burns and is currently in critical condition at the burn center in Portland. Her road to recovery will be a long one and will be further complicated by the devastating loss of her mother and child.?The couple's home and possessions are gone. The medical costs from Angie's physical injuries will be enormous, plus the funeral expenses for Peggy and Wyatt. Chris and Angie's life will never be the same. While no amount of money can bring back Peggy and Wyatt, our family would be incredibly grateful for any help you can provide. This fund will help Chris and Angie deal with the extreme financial devastation this event has caused.?Read more details about the tragic family loss from the devastating Oregon fires in this Statesman Journal story. What happened as told by Capi Lynn of the Statesman Journal?Peggy was a devoted grandmother who always had a smile on her face and always had kind words to give. Wyatt was a kindhearted, strong and brave young boy who was fascinated by trains and loved to go fishing.?This fundraiser is organized by the Tofte family, Susan Vaslev and Mary Tofte, who are Chris Tofte's aunts and Tyler Vaslev who is Chris Tofte's cousin. Chris and Angie have approved this site as has their family.

The family, including Cameryn, 13, Bailey, 12, Landon, 10, Sadie, 7, Jackson 5, and Wilson, 3 had just spent two wonderful weeks visiting close friends in Texas.? ?As they drove down the pitch-dark highway in the middle of what seemed to be nowhere, a tragedy occurred, and they lost control of their vehicle. The Suburban veered from the road and rolled multiple times in a horrific accident that landed it upside down in an area that passing cars could not see them.? The Suburban had been almost entirely crushed, leaving both Brad and Crystal, who is 7 months pregnant, and the family suspended.? Unable to move, Brad was able to use voice command to access his Apple Watch to call 911 for help.? Some of the children were able to release themselves from their seat belts and crawl out and made their way to the side of the road, hoping to find help.? But the parents, Brad and Crystal were unable to remove themselves for over an hour.Help came but, not soon enough for everyone. Even with the help of two Life Flight helicopters and six ambulances, two of Brad and Crystal?ôs children could not be saved. The couple?ôs beautiful daughter Bailey, age 12, and their sweet son Landon, age 10, both suffered fatal injuries and are now with the Lord.? Crystal was Life-flighted from the scene taken to the hospital. It took the Jaws of Life to remove Brad from the vehicle and he and the four children were rushed to two different hospitals.The family sustained a seemingly endless number of critical injuries. Brad was left with a fractured face and a broken knee. Cameryn suffered a broken clavicle and severe cuts all over her body. Crystal has suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs, a broken shoulder, and a shattered foot in addition to extreme wounds on her body.? It is a miracle that six of the eight family members were able to walk away from this horrific accident. They are now beginning the slow process of recovery. Nonetheless, the excruciating physical pain and the unbearable, overwhelming grief is more than just about anyone could bare. Despite this, the family stands firm in their faith and trusts that their God will be glorified. The couple?ôs unborn child appears to be healthy and is maintaining a strong heartbeat. The family looks forward to welcoming the baby in October.This is a loving San Diego family that is incredibly involved in their church, putting God first before all else in their lives.

Lawson Rankin, 18, a strong and caring son, brother and friend, urgently needs to be medically evacuated home from Bali for ongoing treatment. After a terrible scooter accident in Bali on Saturday night, November 30, Lawson is still unconscious in ICU at the Bali International Medical Centre (BIMC). Critical, but stable Lawson needs the best health care possible as soon as possible which means bringing him home. As you can imagine, there are bills over $30,000 for the first few days and with the insurance company not stepping up, we are asking for your help to help his family to get him back to Australia.What Happened?After years of dedication and hard work Lawson is expecting excellent results in his HSC in a just a few weeks. While on Schoolies in Bali, Lawson was trailing 2 friends on a motor scooter. The passenger on the motor scooter was using google maps for directions when a local motorcycle rider snatched the phone and sped off. Lawson being quicker on his scooter took off around the friends??bike in pursuit. Further along the road the boys noticed Lawson?ôs scooter deep in a concrete drain steaming in the water. The boys quickly jumped down into the drain and initially couldn?ôt see him. Shining their torches down further into a large covered section they found Lawson, face down drowning in the sewer with multiple head lacerations and unconscious. They lifted Lawson out of the drain and performed CPR to resuscitate him, locals called an ambulance and Lawson has been unconscious since. Lawson's family are eternally grateful for the heroic actions of these young men.Lawson has had surgery for injuries including around 20 stitches for a head wound caused by his crushed helmet. But, the biggest concerns are for the brain haemorrhage that he suffered and infection from the water that got into his lungs. Thankfully, he has no skull or spinal fractures. Lawson?ôs family are by his side in Bali and while his recovery journey is unknown we know Lawson will continue fighting his best fight with his strong determination.Despite having travel insurance, Lawson was not licenced for a motor bike and the insurance company will not cover any of his medical costs. His family are going to bring him home no matter what it takes, but to support them, we're asking for your help. We need to make it happen as soon as possible, so the focus can be on Lawson?ôs recovery in the time ahead. The bills are already over $30,000 for a few days in an international hospital and he may not be able to travel for weeks, so this will continue to rise. Once there is clearance to get him onto a plane, it's expected a Medivac flight to Sydney and transfers to Newcastle to be more than $100,000. Once home Lawson is likely to have a long journey of rehabilitation.It will be one step at a time, but an expensive journey, if we all pull together we can make a big difference. If you can, please donate today, every bit?will be greatly appreciated!Thank you!***UPDATE*** Thank you so much for the amazing support we have received. Our target was based on supporting Lawson?ôs first four days in ICU and the Medivac home. Lawson is still unconscious for a sixth day in ICU and we just don?ôt know how long this will go on for or when he will be able to fly. He will then have a long road of recovery. With expenses changing daily and the amazing show of support, we are now hoping to cover more of the medical costs for Lawson. We are confident every cent of the target will be needed and we?ôll update as we have more information.***UPDATE, 8/12/19***We?ôre glad to update that Lawson arrived safely by medical evacuation from Bali today. Balinese Police were instrumental in safe passage to the airport, providing motorcade and support?and DFAT assisted in safe travel home.Lawson remains unconscious under sedation at Sydney, Prince of Wales Hospital, Intensive Care Unit with his parents by his side. He is still in a critical condition, but is now with the best medical teams in Australia.The family would like to publicly thank everyone for their support and well wishes, through the GoFundMe and hundreds of messages to the family. Thank you for bringing Lawson home!! The TheGoFund me will close at midnight tonight.?**This page has been created by Lawson's cousins, page organiser and cousin is Taren Brown, Newcastle, NSW. Funds will be used directly for Lawson's medical costs for as long as he is required to stay in Bali, for his medical evacuation as soon as he is safe to travel and his rehabilitation.We are hoping to give the family all the space they need so ask that for any media enquires please contact [email redacted].auRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last week my brother Chris, who is a doctor at a major Canadian hospital, reached out asking if Knix could help get access to PPE as his hospital was likely going to run out. We immediately started contacting our suppliers to see if they could help us and the answer was YES. We've been in touch with government agencies and while this is a top priority for them our fear is that it may take too long to find new supply chain partners and solve for pending stock outs in the near term.??Our aim is to collect donations so that we can order and distribute PPE items ASAP where they are needed most. Ideally we can help bridge any gaps while larger government initiatives are being rolled out so that our healthcare workers can stay safe.Your dollars will go directly towards purchasing these key items so we can donate them. Knix and our partners will cover all costs associated with the shipping and distribution of the items.?Every dollar counts. Here are some rough estimates of how far your donations will go (NOTE Updated with new costing as PPE prices have been on the rise):$10 - 2 x N95 mask$20 - 4 x N95 maks$50 - 100 surgical masks$100 - 500 pairs of surgical gloves$250 - One doctor or nurse kit (estimated gloves, masks and gowns needed for one hospital nurse or doctor for 7 days)?As the sister of someone on the frontline I want to say a big thank you for your support.? This is personal for me as it is for so many of you. We all know people that are putting their lives at risk every day so that we can stay healthy and safe.?I know in times like these we want to find ways to help. We are staying at home, practicing social distancing and emotionally supporting friends and family.

232,Fill Hotels not Graves,"Created April 17, 2020",Accidents & Emergencies,"$250,000 ","$215,633 ",2.1K,3.6K,2.1K,"California has neglected its catastrophic housing affordability and homelessness crisis for years, with our civic leaders prioritizing large scale hotel developments, offering billions in incentives to developers. Now, with the COVID-19 virus grounding the entire world, hundreds of thousands of hotel rooms sit empty while the government continues to deny thousands of unhoused Californians the right to shelter in place.?Here in Oakland, at least 1500 hotel rooms are sitting empty while COVID-19 infections are starting to spread through curbside communities - where folks are forced to share the few portapotties and handwashing stations that volunteers have been able to install. And this outbreak will not be contained in encampments, as unhoused folks do not live in a vacuum. Yet, the City of Oakland continues to make the same lame excuse that they?ôve been peddling for months: They don?ôt know how to run a ?úfull service program?? But unhoused folks don?ôt want to be programmed: ?úJust give us a bed and private bathroom. When we can rest and stay clean, we can take care of our lives just fine by ourselves.?ùSo The Village of Oakland, East Oakland Collective, and Love and Justice in the Streets have launched a program following this principle of self-determination: With community funding we have moved 31 Black elders, veterans, families with children, and particularly immune vulnerable folks into hotel rooms across Oakland. These new hotel communities can now safely receive the same services that our volunteers deliver to curbside communities: hot meals donated by restaurants, grocery bags from the food bank, personal hygiene supplies, visits by volunteer medical professionals, unhoused service providers, and advocates who support self-organization.?To continue and extend this program, all we need is to pay the hotel bill: It takes $700 to immediately shelter a couple or family for a week. And while your elected officials fail to enact this simple public health measure, that means we need your donations: If you can comfortably survive without your stimulus check or parts of your continuing income, then you can make an invaluable contribution to our collective health by helping us pay the bill to shelter folks who may not survive without a roof over their head!?We need everyone sheltered in place - this is how we survive this crisis - together. So, protect your own health today by funding a hotel room for an unhoused neighbor!#NoVacancyCa?#HotelsNotHospitalBeds#HotelsNotGraves#ShelterInPlaceForAllRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To help our local growers and producers and fund recovery efforts, the Adelaide Hills Wine Region has set up a Fire Appeal.While some individual wineries have set up their own fundraising efforts, there are others who are still dealing with the aftermath and some are not in a position to think about doing the same. Many of the grape growers that have been affected the most have no public profile, no brand to get behind and no wine to sell. Family businesses are still dealing with the shock, some of them considering their futures as destroyed vineyards can take years to regenerate. Funds will be distributed through our Incorporated Association to the growers and producers affected by the recent fires. Funds will be managed in house by the association with State Government guidance as per our Association's usual practices with industry levies.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yiakl set up fundraising task force to support Eritrean refugees in different parts of the world.As we are aware of the situation the pandemic is expanding across the globe in a lightning speed. The crisis is creating turmoil in all parts of the world including big and powerful countries like USA. In response to this international crisis Global yiakl decided to set up a fundraising task force to support all Eritrean refuges in different parts of the world with its focus in Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya.Due to the lack of basic healthcare and other fundamental human services, if Covid 19 is spreading in refugee camps of the neighboring countries, the consequence will be very dire to Eritrean refugees in those camps. To minimize the damage and death of Eritreans including small children and woman, Global Yiakl decided to stand by our people and calls for all Eritrean in diaspora to stand side by side with their people.For transparency and accountability purpose, the task force is composed of four different subcommittees. The subcommittees are: fundraising, Disbursing and distribution, Audit and media committee. These groups have different number of people depending on the scope of their tasks. These subcommittees will make sure the checks and balances required to utilize public funds collected to support our Eritrean brothers and sisters. In addition to the four subcommittees, there will be one representative from each city to facilitate the fundraising in their respective cities and states. The task force would like to promise to the public there will be periodic updates on the statues of the work until the task is completed.At the end of the task, Global? Yiakl? will present its report to the public on the completion of the mission and how the funds were disbursed on the intended purpose. In addition to the Global Yiakl report, the Audit sub-committee will also present the Audit result of the task force to the public. Global Yiakl calls on all Eritreans in diaspora to stand shoulder to shoulder with their brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, friends, daughters and sons.? This mission can only be accomplished when all of us come together for the sake of our people.Hope to our people in darkness!Thank you.Global?

Approximately two months ago Oscar?ôs grandfather, Sten-B√∂rje, one of his most inspiring role models passed away, then a month later his younger brother, Gustaf, who was in the application process to go to college, unexpectedly and unimaginably died, only 20 years old. Finally, last week a hazardous fire burned down his family home in Sweden containing all the remaining memories and belonging of his brother. All this within only two months.Coming together and showing support to Oscar and his parents, Rikard and Sofia, is more important now than ever. We will never be able to bring back Oscar?ôs lost time with his brother or replace the belongings that burned down in the fire. But with your gift, you can contribute to the family N√§varp slowly rebuilding their life again.That is why I am reaching out to the Seton Hall community, former teammates, friends, and family to help Oscar and his family, and to make sure that Oscar can return to Seton Hall for a final season in the Fall and Graduate among all his friends.We are asking for US$20,000.

Jessica is a health care worker for a local children's hospital and Todd a Project Manager for a construction company. He works a very physically demanding job, he loves to build things, is an avid cyclist, and loves doing anything outdoors. This year has been a long one. They purchased a home almost a year ago that needed a complete renovation. Todd worked a full-time job during the day and went to the new house after he got off work and worked late into the night and every weekend getting it liveable for his family, doing most of the work himself. During this time he saw his family very little. They were able to move into their home in June, but they still have several things that were left unfinished. If you know this family, you must also know that they are both fighters. Jess and Todd are both in long-term recovery, and both have more than 10 years sober.?Jess is terrified about what their future holds, but she is holding it together for her family. Todd is currently in the surgical ICU with no clear idea of when he will be able to start rehabilitation. At this point, he has had two surgeries and will likely need more. He does have use of his arms, but the broken sternum is preventing him from bearing no more than 10 pounds. The University hospital is not in-network for their insurance and the hope is that once he is out of the ICU he can be moved to an in-network hospital to continue receiving care. The road to recovery is long and the financial strain is overwhelming. Everyone is asking what they can do to help, and right now, the most helpful thing would be for them to be able to focus on his rehabilitation, instead of how they are going to pay for it.? Jess is currently taking unpaid time off because her PTO must be saved to have time off when their baby is born. This money will go directly to the family for medical bills, rehab, and equipment for him as well as equipment to make their home wheelchair accessible, and any other related expenses. Todd's spirits range from joking with the nurses to being absolutely crushed that he may never mow the lawn with his little buddy again. Jess feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now and I am hoping, with the help of people who are as kind and generous as they are, we can help carry them through this. She never asks anyone for anything and reluctantly agreed to let me start this fund because she never wants to be a burden to anyone. I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to read this. If you can't donate, please share and say a prayer for their family. In an attempt to help alleviate the stress of keeping so many people updated, I will share updates directly from Jess to this page as often as they are available.?Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Completing this journey has been a dream for Glenn ??and one he has prepared for virtually his entire sailing life.?After considerable planning and preparation, Glenn set sail aboard West Wind II on September 6, 2020, on his third attempt to complete this solo circumnavigation. Tragically, on September 16, approximately 500 nautical miles west of San Francisco, Glenn suffered a massive stroke. Before losing consciousness, Glenn managed to send a message to his family that he needed help. ?Help Us Bring Glenn HomeWe have launched this Go Fund Me campaign at a moment of great uncertainty. Glenn is in critical condition in a trauma center in San Jose, California, after a 48-hour ?òat sea??rescue and emergency medevac to this specialized hospital. He has undergone surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain, and at this time, is in the ICU. Because of COVID-19, Glenn?ôs family ??his wife MaryLou and daughters Claire and Nicola ??are unable to travel to see Glenn. The anticipated medical expenses for his stay and care at a U.S. hospital are undetermined at this time, but expected to be well over one hundred thousand dollars. Glenn did not anticipate touching U.S. soil, and as such, did not have U.S. medical insurance. ?An added complication, will be the costs required to recover and bring Glenn?ôs boat home, which is adrift off the coast of California.The family is asking for financial support from the sailing community and from Glenn?ôs many friends from all over the world to help the family resolve his U.S. medical bills and bring him home to Victoria, British Columbia for care. Plans are underway to do this, while he receives the best possible medical attention in San Jose. Glenn is deeply loved and we want so very much to bring him home.?The Rescue MissionMany of you have reached out to send your love and concern and ask us what happened and how Glenn was rescued. The US Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) Alameda took responsibility for the rescue and launched a mission that had many operational logistics. What follows is an abridged description of the rescue:-?????? On September 16, MaryLou notified the US Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) Alameda of Glenn?ôs medical distress message. Glenn managed to relay that he thought he was having? a stroke and needed assistance.?-?????? The first step taken by the US Coast Guard was issuing a SafetyNet broadcast asking for any vessels in the area to assist if possible. MaryLou advised that Glenn?ôs GPS position was approximately 420 nm northwest of San Francisco.-?????? The Coast Guard and nearby ship M/V COLOMBO EXPRESS worked together and a small rescue boat was able to transfer Glenn, who was not conscious, to the larger ship. Rough seas initially impeded this phase of the rescue.-?????? On September 17, Glenn was hoisted from the M/V COLOMBO EXPRESS via the 129th Rescue Wing airborne division. Several in-air refueling evolutions were required during this operation and a total of 5 planes were involved in the rescue. Glenn was then safely transported to the San Jose Regional Hospital at approximately 1230 PDT.??Thank you from MaryLou, Claire and Nicola This is a devastating situation for our family. We are shocked, saddened and filled with worry for Glenn?ôs recovery. Glenn is a person who pushes through difficulty and always comes out on top. He is strong, passionate and full of life. We never imagined he would be stricken by something like this. All the hours we have spent worrying about the gales and seas he has to manage??but never this. We want so much to bring him home as soon as possible. And to bare our souls further, asking for help is very uncomfortable for us, but ask we must, and we hope you will help our family to get through this terrible time by giving what you can to help us bring Glenn home and address his daunting medical expenses. Thank you for caring. Thank for reaching out to us. We love you all and thank for your support of our family over the years, and of Glenn personally, then and now. Updates will be posted on Glenn?ôs Going Solo blog as we learn more about his condition and potential for recovery. To everyone involved in his rescue, his medical team in the U.S. and to our friends here in Victoria, we can?ôt thank you enough.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can watch it happen through the video updates to supporters, and through the google sheet?driving our estimates and logging the actions as they are taken. The people and companies listed above are involved on a volunteer basis.What about your overheads?Our overheads are covered by our regular business activities (both Muraho and Raw Material produce and sell coffee to fund their operations).Why are there some differences in dollar values?Costs on the ground are in RWF. The ever-changing exchange rates used to find USD and AUS estimates create fluctuations across time. This Go Fund Me campaign requires that we collect donations in AUD. RWF isn't an option, USD is only an option for those living in the USA.Why is this ""hosted by Matt Graylee"", not Raw Material or Muraho?Raw Material is registered as a CIC (community interest company) and Muraho is a private company. While most of our team members are giving their time to run this campaign, we aren't registered charities, and this isn't our usual mode of operation. Therefore, we can't set up as a charity on the GFM platform. There are geography/currency constraints that make running this from Australia the best option, hence Matt. For transparency reasons GFM don?ôt allow the ?úhosted by??message to be toggled off. Where can I download a media kit, so I can build promotional material or publish an article?Here is a link to the first images and logos.Here?is a live Google album with photo and video updates as they happen.For inspiration, our friends at Daily Coffee News,?Sprudge, and Bean Scene?have covered this disaster and relief effort.

Adam Haner's is my little brother. He's living in Portland, I was right across the river from him in Vancouver WA before I moved. Hoping this money will help Adam get things together for his life after the attack he suffered. I know he will need repairs, or to replace the truck that was wrecked. He is going to need time to recover from his injuries as well. Plus replace things that where stolen from his pick-up that night, on Aug 16th. which happens to be my birthday. His girlfriend had some help getting his truck towed home while he slept tonight, Aug 17th. Maybe he will use some of this money to move out of Portland, or just use it to move up. I really don't care what he uses it for. He would give the shirt off his back to help any of the people around him, and he really didn't deserve what happened to him in Portland. I'll supply updates here as I can, and may update the 'story' on the GFM to better detail how this will all get handled. I really through this up in a hurry, because I was getting so many messages to start the GFM for him. After spending most of my day looking for information on what happened to him, and letting my mom and family know he was alive and home, I started replying to all the DM's and messages on social media, and started this GFM and replied to as many massages as I could. I currently have enough free time in Arizona to mostly keep up with something this demanding. So hopefully, I'll get to reply to all of you that have question, want proof it's really for Adam, and get you updates as there is information available. Huge Thank You to everyone showing him support. This is going to be an awakening experience for my brother in so many ways. He's always been cynical about the world at large, but has always been someone willing to step up and speak up to help someone being treated unfairly.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The harms of incarceration, while heightened by the pandemic, are not contained to this historical moment, and we firmly believe that by continuing to show up and care for all members of our community, we can work towards a safer and more equitable world. The overwhelming show of solidarity has encouraged us to continue to raise and distribute money from the Prisoner Emergency Support Fund.?This fund is intended for people inside prisons and jails and recently released prisoners. People behind bars often need support to contact their loved ones or purchase essential items on their canteen. Recently released prisoners need access to funds for housing, food, clothing, and physical and mental health supports. Families who still have loved ones behind bars need funds for expensive phone bills and canteens.As of September 2020:Money Raised $132,170.00Money Distributed $125,700.00Applications Received 1,072Number of People Supported 559Number of People Still in Need of Support 513In Need of $115,500.00IMPORTANT NOTEThis fund is created based on a shared community trust system. We want to reduce the barriers that invasive questions pose to accessing support while being accountable and transparent to our community.Funds will be released on a first-come-first-served basis. We want to honour this commitment by trusting that those who have the means will seek out those means, and leave this fund to be accessed by those of us who have little to no choice.?This fund is limited. Using community donations, we will continue to distribute funds for as long as we can. We recognize that this, too, will not be sufficient to bridge the deep gaps that this crisis has caused.?To preserve each other's privacy and dignity, we will never publish the names or details of the recipients. Still, we will give periodic updates to our community on the number of people who have been served by this fund.How to Apply?If you need support from the Prisoner Emergency Support Fund, follow the link below to the application (make sure to click NEXT to start the application and hit SUBMIT to finish the application): Apply to the Prisoner Emergency Support Fund.?We are continuing to fundraise money to meet the needs of the people that have applied to the fund previously.?We will continue to distribute money to applicants to the fund while prioritizing people in emergencies.?How We Distribute FundsAs of September 2020, we have already received more than 1,072 applications to the Prisoner Emergency Support Fund. Volunteers with the Criminalization and Punishment Education Project and the Toronto Prisoners Rights Project review each application and distribute the money accordingly. Most of the applicants that have been released will receive the funds by e-transfer or money order. We will be sending the money to trusted loved ones of people still inside to deposit onto their canteen for sanitation supplies.?Raise Money for the FundThe Prisoner Emergency Support Fund has only been as successful because of grassroots groups taking up the call to action. You can support the Prisoner Emergency Support Fund by organizing an auction, collecting donations at your next meeting or event, writing a motion to an organization you are a member of or talking to people in your neighbourhood. Together, we are creating the world we want to live in. A world without police and without prisons.?Prisoner Resource SheetThe Ontario Prisoners??Resource Guide is supplementary support to the Prisoner Emergency Support Fund. When applying for the fund, incarcerated community members (inside and recently home) or their family members requested additional supports, such as connections to housing, employment supports, et cetera. This document is a compilation of various resources all throughout Ontario that can be of use to someone coming out of jail or prison. This resource compilation is a working list extremely open to feedback.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have come together during these hard times because all of us originate from the Tigray province and we want to make sure that the right help is given to our people. We are three women who started out this group, our names are: Milete Solomon, Tirhas Tesfay and Neham Hassen.A full scale humanitarian crisis is unfortunately unfolding in Tigray at this moment. The ethiopian federal government and the ruling body in Tigray, TPLF, has clashed into a gruesome war beginning in November 2020. Tigrayans are now fleeing ongoing fightings to seek safety in neighbouring Sudan. 4000 people are reported to cross the border daily and close to 30 000 are now present in Sudan. It is reported by the UNHCR that the human response capacity on the ground is being overwhelmed.?Just before the war broke out, there were swarms of desert locusts that damaged 200,000 hectares of crops in Tigray, a region already struggling with food insecurity. Now a full fledged war has been added to this scarcity.?The economical impact on this area will be extensive. Mostly on a humanitarian level.?That is why we urge you to donate to help us help the refugees in Sudan and the tigrayans in Tigray.?We have local contacts in Tigray which we will send the funds to. We are working on establishing a trusted contact in Sudan at the moment. Basic necessities will be purchased in the local community since its cheaper and because it will stimulate the local economy. Due to the inherent difficulty with obtaining resets in the local areas, we will try to do our best to report the costs, but we will also film och photograph the whole process in the sake of transparance.?We are aiming at buying water, food supplies, hygienic articles and medicines if necessary.??We cannot contact any of these organisations due to the communication lines being cut off to Tigray at the moment.

The village of Supai, where 426 of the 769 Havasupai Tribal Members live, is accessible only by foot, horseback, or helicopter.? An additional 25 Tribal Members live in the satellite community of Supai Camp, a historic and continuous settlement of the Havasupai People located within their aboriginal territory in what is now known as the Grand Canyon National Park.? Roughly 75 percent of the jobs on the Havasupai Reservation are tied to the tourism economy, and this economy is fragile with roughly 15 percent unemployment.? Roughly 15 percent of the community is elderly, and many are diabetic or asthmatic, and thus particularly vulnerable to Coronavirus.?Due to the rapid spread of Coronavirus and COVID-19 in the United States and Arizona, the Tribe has had to temporarily suspend tourism within the Reservation in order to protect Tribal Members from the spread of this pandemic.? Thus, the tourism revenues the Tribe relies upon to run its government, and its Tribal Members depend upon to feed their families and their animals, has been disrupted.? For example, the Tribe's 60-day closure of the Reservation to tourism is expected to result in an estimated loss of 15 percent of the Tribe?ôs annual revenues.? Additionally, non-essential travel into and out of the Canyon has been suspended, including for Tribal Members.? However, there is only one small grocery mart in Supai.? The Tribe is bringing in bulk food supplies to its people for themselves and their animals, but additional help is needed, especially as the pandemic is projected to remain in full force for a number of months.??Please consider making a donation to ensure that the Havasupai People and their animals have the food and the Personal Protection Equipment that they need to remain in their communities and be protected from exposure to the Coronavirus and COVID-19.? Prevention is paramount because the Tribe does not have a permanent doctor or nurse on the Reservation, and they do not have a single ventilator or hospital bed.? With such a small Tribe, the spread of this disease within the Canyon and Supai Camp could be devastating to the Tribal community and to the continued viability of the Havasupai People.? Any contribution will help and will be greatly appreciated by the Tribe and the Havasupai People.? I am the General Counsel to the Tribe and will ensure that these funds are deposited directly with the Tribe through its Chief Financial Officer, Jim Usevitch, and are used for food, pet food, and PPE for the community during their COVID-19 response period.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Andrew is our local IT Guru from ?úCutter Fix IT??based in the Northern suburb of Banksia Grove, Perth WA and has been a saviour when it comes to our IT disasters over the years.? Andrew is such a friendly & positive guy; you cannot help but fall in love with him once you?ôve met him. He works incredibly hard and goes above and beyond to support the community and is often up from the crack of dawn, until the early hours offering IT support and working on jobs to ensure that computers get fixed, lost data is recovered and upgrades are seamless for his clients.Andrew is currently facing his own battle; his health has failed him, leaving him unable to work to support his beautiful partner Chrissy & their gorgeous 6 month old son Nate.? Times are incredibly tough and this Aussie family could really use a helping hand financially to help pay for his treatment and allow Andrew the time and strength to fight this terrible disease without the added financial burden causing even more stress to him and his family.Andrew discovered his first Melanoma in September 2018. He underwent invasive surgery in October 2018, his results were all clear and there was nothing else apparent. The surgeons were satisfied that they had removed the tumour and Andrew had been extremely lucky to discover the Melanoma and have it successfully removed prior to it causing any further issues as they can be extremely aggressive.However Andrew?ôs luck ran out and just after Andrew & Chrissy celebrated the birth of their beautiful son Nate, ?Andrew discovered a lump in his neck (July 2019) and their lives spiralled into an array of Dr?ôs appointments, emergency hospital stays, surgery and scans. A PET scan highlighted the need for immediate invasive neck and facial surgery to remove lymph nodes now affected by the cancer. Surgery took place at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH) in Perth in September 2019 and following surgery the pathology results brought more bad news. ?Andrew was diagnosed with Stage 3c Melanoma. His recovery was slow and painful and SCGH became his second home.Following his surgery Andrew was prescribed Immunotherapy as a treatment plan; moving forward, however this caused multiple issues including Pneumonitis which left Andrew unable to breathe properly and yet another emergency admission into SCGH for treatment with high dose IV antibiotics and steroids. Andrew was unable to eat or drink for 2 weeks and his body was showing signs of shutting down. The Immunotherapy treatment was stopped and Andrew was finally discharged from hospital and home to his beautiful family for support not knowing what his future held.A follow up PET scan then showed signs of cancer back in the neck, lungs and possibly liver. Not the news Andrew & his family wanted to hear, as his cancer was now classed as Stage 4 Melanoma.2 weeks later Andrew was rushed back to SCGH suffering a failing liver, possible caused by an immune response produced by the Immunotherapy and spent another week in hospital, away from his family.Andrews only option now is a treatment that costs up to $19,000 a month. The hospital budget will not cover this treatment option, so it is up to Andrew & Chrissy to now find the money to cover his treatment. Fortunately it is discounted for patients, however it is still a significant out of pocket expense for them to cover, on top of covering everyday living expenses whilst Andrew is too unwell to work full time and Chrissy is on unpaid Maternity leave to care for baby Nate & now Andrew too.So far although it?ôs early days the treatment has shrunk a swollen lymph node in his neck which is a positive sign that the treatment is working and making a difference.Andrew and Chrissy have no other option but to remain positive that Andrew will be able to afford his treatment and that it will continue to offer him some relief.Being proud hard working Australians, both Andrew & Chrissy have been reluctant to ask others for financial support, however if each and every one of us could dig deep; maybe go without our take away coffee for the week or donate the coins we have been saving it would go a long way to brining some relief for Andrew & Chrissy and make their lives slightly less ?úTough??and stressful as they continue to battle this cruel and debilitating disease.If you can, Please donate now, then spread the link far and wide:Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My institution encouraged students to seek their own truth; emphasizing that there is no right answer when approaching life. This open-minded and imaginative mindset led me on a gap year to Sweden with the International Youth Initiative Program. During this program, I lived and learned with 25 other students from 14 different countries. Together, we explored the international world examining both personal and global action. We also learned about the evolution of consciousness and the evolutionary development of the human species. Trough this program and these studies I realize that these ideas are concepts that I care about and want to engage in on a deeper level in University. To study aboard has been a dream of mine for years, and one I have actively pursued for the past few years. I love the school so much and it would mean everything for me to spend my college years there. Despite my ambition to pursue tertiary studies and also having a strong passion for psychology, there is a hindrance to my plan as my family is unable to accumulate the money needed for tuition, miscellaneous fees and other expenses that contribute to the preparation for school, since they currently encounter a huge issue in their life that unable to slove. With that, as an adult there's no reason to add more pressure on them, over the summer, I spent countless hours looking for funding and working resources to make my dreams a reality. Currently, I'm working in a public relations company called Veda in the weekday and a part-time job as a bartender in Taipei, Taiwan to support my living cost.?I want to say that throughout the time when I was in YIP I realized that the pathway to our dream has multiple ways and there's nothing to do with how wealthy you are, so I chose to pursue several volunteer jobs throughout Taiwan these past few months but realized that this time Money plays a big role in my life and influence my choices. Since current Taiwan still in the pace of development to provide the resources and support for people to study abroad, there's no chance to get a student loan nither in Taiwan nor New Zealand, It would be easy for me to say that there aren't scholarships out there for me, but that is not the reality. There are scholarships and grants, but they are difficult to come by as an international student.So I'm seeking a donation towards my tuition fee for my first year of study, one year of tuition appr US$ 22,746, three years in total, if you would like to further support me for the second year of tuition, I would be extremely grateful but that is more than I could ever ask for. I take this opportunity to invite you to be part of my educational journey in achieving my goals and dreams so that my education will open the doors to success in the near future. I appreciate any donation, no matter how small. If you are unable to donate, please share this campaign. Thank you in advance! Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

297,The Free Black University Fund,"Created June 3, 2020",Education & Learning,"¬£250,000","¬£138,629",2.8K,1.9K,2.8K,"Education is at the heart of growth and transformation in our society. Today we stand at a critical juncture in our collective history ??things cannot continue the same after this moment. It is imperative we focus on what the production of knowledge looks like after this point. The Free Black University is a hub for radical and transformative knowledge production. The fight to decolonise education has been going on for years and it has become ever clearer that more is required than what the current education system can offer. Universities hold a deep responsibility when it comes to racism, the knowledge that introduced the very ideology of racism into our society was born in British Universities. The Free Black University exists to re-distribute knowledge and act as a space of incubation for the creation of transformative knowledge in the Black community. We firmly believe education should centre Black people healing and it should be free, anti-colonial, and accessible to all ??so we will provide it.? Further, the University is often a site of trauma for far too many Black students and so our project brings well being and the healing of our community to the fore.This project also brings climate justice to the fore as we recognise the relationship between the climate crisis and colonialism. Climate justice will run through all of the threads of our work as we centre structural and holistic approaches to preserving the world we all live in.We MUST engage critical thought in the wider mission for liberation and freedom, the world is ever changing, and the thought leaders of the next generation need deep and transformational spaces to develop their thinking in the face of the present challenges. The long-term vision for this work is to: 1)??? The transformation of minds is critical to the transformation of society and so we will specifically provide Black radical books to people right across the community who would otherwise not have access to it ??this includes those incarcerated2)??? Deliver a range of open access and very accessible online lectures and teachings to the community exploring radical and transformational topics3)??? Create a space of community and care for Black students ??there is a mental health crisis amongst Black students that universities are failing to sufficiently address. As an organisation healing is a foundational principle ??this will be a space through which Black students can connect to various modes of support and healing work. mental health support and healing work. We will connect with Black therapists, counsellors, and community healers to offer a range of support to our community4)??? Build an open access, free, and expansive online library of radical readings writings from people across the world ??we will no longer stand for the gatekeeping of knowledge for those who desire access to it5)??? Build a publication ??the type of knowledge that is being produced will only ever be as radical as the ?òpeers??reviewing will allow it to be. Our journal, and later our Press, will centre radical and transformational thought that may not be respected under the current frame of knowledge. Our work will be driven by the radical Black imagination, it is all that can cut through Eurocentric thought.? 6)??? A member?ôs space for emerging Black academics that need support and community during and beyond their academic journey7)??? A podcast that will explore complex and transformational ideas in accessible and simplistic ways ??this podcast will speak to Black thinkers, organisers, academics, spiritualists, creatives, etc. The podcast is to allow absolutely anyone to tune in and learn something new about the history, present, and futures of Black liberation through a critical lens8)??? We will build a physical space ??a hub for our work and a space for all Black people to access. This space will include; teaching rooms, a book shop, restaurant, and healing areas. The entire space will be created intentionally and in the interest of anti-colonial and healing work. 9)??? An annual conference that brings together Black radical thinkers (that are not only academics) to collectively produce knowledge and vision for Black liberation10) FREE AND ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION CENTRED ON THE FREEDOM OF BLACK PEOPLE WHICH NECESSARILY SUCCEEDS THE FREEDOM OF ALL PEOPLEWhat we are doing here is transformative ??it has the potential to entirely transform the landscape of education and knowledge production. This world CLEARLY needs new and transformative ideas if we are to ever stamp out the visceral racism that exists across the world. Black thinkers and Black visionaries need to lead this intellectual revolution ??the best way that we can do that is through creating intentionally anti-colonial and caring spaces for Black students to do this work. Let us show universities all over the world just what can be done when the agenda of Black liberation is at the heart of building spaces that produce knowledge and teach. This project is Black, queer, trans, anti-colonial, and revolutionary from its very heart. Help us bring this vision into fruition.What your donation could do:??¬£15 will buy one book for people in the community ¬£50 would pay for a podcast episode and equipment ?¬£150 would pay for a days work behind the scenes?¬£200 would pay for one free admission to our annual conference¬£300 would pay for a collective healing session for Black students ¬£350 would pay for one community radical workshop for Black folk to attend ¬£500 would pay to create one publicly accessible lecture¬£1000 would pay for the process of publication for a journal article and building towards our University Press ¬£50,000 is the suggested initial contribution from UK universities ??this is less than the cost for two students to complete a 3-year degree ??this money would go directly to the fund to build a physical spaceIf you have any enquiries please email us at [email redacted]Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pandemic is certainly affecting everyone in our country in one way or another. However, the Murabito kids, James 23, Katie 21 and Caroline 17, have lost their dad. Jimmy was on a ventilator in ICU for over 21 days, and although he received excellent care, it was not enough to save his life. The kids are devastated as they have lost their best friend, their role model, their rock, and their grounding force in an uncertain world.Jimmy had a successful small business in Harrison, NY, the town he was raised in and the town in which he raised his children. As a lifelong member of our community, MANY people know and care for Jimmy.? So many people have been asking how they can help, and this fundraising effort is in response to the outpouring of support & concern for the Murabito children. Sadly, with the death of Jimmy, the children will no longer have the parental or financial support that he provided. It is our hope that the community will step up and help them during this time of uncertainty. Katie is accepted to Columbia University this fall for graduate school; Caroline will be a senior at Harrison High School next fall and will be applying to colleges. Although young adults, these kids have their whole lives in front of them, and the prospect of a life without their dad's love and support is daunting.?Thank you in advance for your help, your support, and most importantly your continued love for James, Katie and Caroline at this very difficult time in their lives. If you would prefer to send a check to the kids, you can mail it to 35 Century Trail/Harrison/NY/10528 which is where they are currently residing: Thank you.?Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Help to promote fair, effective and accountable policingBackground Who is StopWatch?StopWatch is a national research and action organisation that has been operating in the UK since 2010; it became a formal registered charitable organisation in 2015. StopWatch is a coalition of academics, lawyers, civil liberties activists, and community stakeholders that work to promote fair, effective and accountable policing for all.For the last decade StopWatch has been the leading independent voice on stop and search and disproportionate policing. The organisation formed in response to unprecedented increases in the number of stop-searches, consistently high disproportionality and government proposals increasing police powers and reducing accountability.We produce high quality research, briefings and resources gaining attention, credibility and trust from statutory, legal, academic and community stakeholders. Recent reports include Dr. Mike Shiner et al 'The Colour of Injustice: Race, Drugs and Law Enforcement'. Dr. Patrick Williams and Temi Mwale led on our 'Being Matrixed:The Over(Policing) of Gang Suspects' research.? With emerging policing equipment and technology a concern, we published a briefing 'Call it Off: Are Police searching mobile phones illegally?'. More recently we wrote to a range of elected representatives and statutory bodies to inform them about the impact of COVID and the disparities in how communities are being policed, stopped and fined. A letter to the Independent Office of Police Conduct raising concerns about the disproportionate use of Tasers against black males was sent in response to recent incidents in Manchester and London.? Keen to ensure that the voices of people impacted by adverse policing are heard, we have responded to consultations from the Home Office, College of Policing and Her Majesty?ôs ?Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC). Last year we met with senior civil servants and special advisors to Prime Ministers May and Johnson. We were also invited to give oral evidence at the MacPherson 20 years On Inquiry.?Utilising our strong community links, StopWatch also provides harm reduction services to young people and hosts a range of public events aimed at raising awareness and building community resilience. We assist community members, such as Neomi Bennet BEM, to challenge unjustifiable stops, searches and arrests by providing legal advice and much need pastoral support. The Y?ìStop video linked with this campaign is a youth led creation that was made by StopWatch?ôs youth group and is aimed to empower other young people to confidently and safely engage with police.To address policing issues in the UK we have partnered with Release, Liberty, The Runnymede Trust, Amnesty International and have strong links with Big Brother Watch. StopWatch has participated in interviews for Channel 4, Sky News, ITV and the BBC and featured in articles in The Guardian, The Independent, The Daily Mail and The Observer.With no other civil society organisation solely focussed on disproportionate policing, StopWatch is providing scrutiny, applying pressure and using research and communities??lived experiences to bring about meaningful and long-term reforms to policing. We believe that everyone should be treated fairly and with dignity by police officers .Call to Action - Donate Please!Following the tragic death of George Floyd in the USA, StopWatch has been contacted by many people wanting to know how they can provide support to organisations in the UK that focus on ensuring police accountability and promoting community empowerment. Being acutely aware of the plethora of policing issues that black communities face here at home in the UK, StopWatch has launched this fundraising page to make it easier for people in the UK to donate and support the essential work that we are doing. Whilst the situation in the USA is of great focus, we cannot express how much communities in the UK need your support! StopWatch has a long standing track record in this arena and is committed to challenging unfair policing and prompting positive community relationships. As a volunteer led organisation, we mainly rely on the generosity of trusts and grant funders to operate. We DO NOT accept funding from the government or police as we believe this would compromise our ability to critically challenge.?With your donation we ensure that the great policy and important community work that we do continues to have a positive impact. Any financial assistance you can provide is greatly appreciated and will supports us to become more sustainable. ?Please DONATE and help spread the word. ?For more information visit https://www.stop-watch .org,?Follow us on Twitter StopWatchUKKeep in the know via our newsletter https://stopwatchuk.substack.com/Thank you!In solidarity and unity we standKatrina FfrenchChief ExecutiveStopWatchRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She passed on Sunday, November 8th, 2020, at the age of 35 years, after a year-long battle with metastatic breast cancer. Irene left behind her loving husband, Daniel, and their three beautiful children: Erik (6 years old), Evan (4 years old), and Emma (1-year old). We are all heartbroken by her passing. Our hearts especially ache thinking about the impact of her loss on their three young children.?Irene meant the world to us. She was a loving wife, sister, daughter, as well as a dedicated mother and a treasured friend. Her life would seem too short for many, but those who were touched by her understand that the quality of existence far exceeds the quantity of time which one lives. Her warm embrace and caring heart brought so much joy to those around her, even when times were tough. Irene made friends everywhere she went and was loved by so many.?Irene's dedication to her three young children and their education has inspired all of us, she showed us through action the power of a mother's love. In her final year battling cancer, her blog documenting her fight against cancer also touched us dearly. She was courageous, wise, and generous with sharing her struggle despite the terrible physical discomfort she was enduring. She inspired both her close friends and people she did not know to live healthier, more fulfilling, and more courageous lives. By sharing her journey, she taught us that each life moment matters, so make it count.? We will miss her forever and will be forever grateful to her.?We know that the road ahead for Daniel and the three children will be extremely challenging, we also know one of the most important things to Irene is her three young children's care and education. Thus, we want to do everything that we can to support them. This fund-raising effort seeks to help alleviate Daniel from some of the present and future financial childcare burden and educational expenses associated with raising three children alone.Thank you for coming together to support Daniel and their three children.

Click here !!]? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? --------------------------------------------------------------SO, WHAT'S UP!?I was recently accepted (Yeeiii!!!) to the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, to pursue a Master in Global Health. (Double Yeeeeii!!)Starting this August, my aim is to understand the fundamental drivers of health and to acquire the skills needed to implement health-related programs and promote health systems development in humanitarian settings. By taking a multidisciplinary and human rights-based approach, I hope, through my work, to reduce health and gender inequities in fragile states and post-conflict scenarios.My request? In these times of crisis, I ask you to think about how much you can impact the lives of those less fortunate by supporting the education of a professional in global health issues who promises to dedicate his life to do the same.My commitment? (1) I will bring my skills, knowledge, compassion and talents to those most in need and serve them with my knowledge, my hands and my heart. (2) Each cent goes ONLY to pay the tuition. I will work my ass off to pay for food and housing. (3) I will keep you updated of the payments and the journey. I need you to help them!THE STORY!I believe my journey began when I chose to serve vulnerable communities of immigrants and people living below the national poverty line during my social internship in Dominican Republic. By delivering in-home care and training community health volunteers I witnessed the reality of immigrant populations whose main problem was social acceptance rather than solely financial challenges. Suddenly I understood that my approach to improving people's lives was not broad enough.[A quick review of who I am: Meet Dr Jose Garcia Ulerio?] Looking to gain experience and knowledge in the field of Public Health, I left my comfort zone and adventured to intern at CMMB in New York City, USA. While analyzing international policies and designing health projects for African villages I broadened my comprehension of life as a whole.[Want to know my volunteer story? Read it all here! The time is always right to do what is right?]?I was awarded an Aurora Fellowship through CMMB and placed as a volunteer in Kenya; an opportunity to bring my medical skills and knowledge to a place where it was desperately needed. This volunteer placement in Africa was a remarkable milestone in my pursuit to live a life that worked to alleviate suffering. It also allowed me to actively participate in the daily life of people in hard-to-reach areas in Kenya, and then later in the war-torn Nuba Mountains of Sudan. Witnessing and to some extent experiencing first hand, the challenges that they face because of the environmental and social conditions, allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of their lives. I also saw the impact of impaired sociopolitical agencies and the importance of public policies to catalyze social changes.From the hospital to the dispensary, to the schools and to the sun-dried clay-brick houses, I have lived my commitment as a doctor to go beyond the walls of the consultation room. And here is where you come aboard my friends. I need you!!This April I was accepted to the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, to pursue a Master in Global Health. Your support is directed to pay the tuition fee.This knowledge will allow me to go back to the field more prepared to tackle the global issueas that disturb the most: gender and health inequealities, and absolute poverty.

The program is designed to create pathways for young Black Americans to get their start in politics. The Gayle family needs to raise an additional $80,000 to make the program permanent at Clemson, and is also considering expanding to other schools.?Each year, two students will be selected as Tyrone Gayle Scholars. These students will receive a $3,500 stipend to pursue a summer internship in a political field. This could be on a campaign, on Capitol Hill, at an advocacy organization, or in other government sectors. In addition to the stipend, these students will be matched with a number of different mentors from Tyrone?ôs network. These mentors will guide the students through the often insular political world, help them make the most of their internships, and help them build their network. Tyrone adamantly believed that nothing in this country could change until the people in power look like the people they represent. And in Tyrone?ôs eyes, that begins in part by creating opportunities in our campaigns, our advocacy organizations, and in our Hill offices for Black Americans. Tyrone also knew this would not change until we knock down the barriers that prevent Black Americans from joining and advancing in political careers. ?To learn more about the program and Tyrone?ôs legacy, click here?. ?Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

314,"Lost Parents Due to COVID, Need Funds for College","Created July 12, 2020",Education & Learning,"$100,000 ","$89,720 ",2.3K,5.5K,2.4K,"Hi! I'm Roberto Tobias and I'm currently a rising senior at Frank McCourt High School in New York City. With the start of Senior year rapidly approaching, the same goes for the intimidating season of college applications.Ever since elementary school, I've always seen my education as an important aspect of my life. I always strived to do my best, hell, even past the expectations that I thought was set for myself. From elementary school to middle school and especially high school, I always aspired to pursue my goals and dreams.With my drive and desire to succeed, I was able to achieve many amazing feats throughout my academic career. As of the end of my Junior year, I was able to finish the year with an overall GPA of 93, I received an opportunity to work as an assistant at Mt. Sinai Queens, I have helped organize many events under Student Government, and I actively volunteer at events for my school to support my hardworking teachers.?Just as millions of people around the world have experienced the harsh realities of COVID-19, I had as well. Throughout the entirety of March of this year, my entire family, including myself, ended up catching COVID. My father, Roberto Tobias Sr., was the first to realize the severity of the virus. Originally, he was the one to warn my sister and I to be careful whenever we went outside. He took the virus seriously from the start, especially due to his ailments. He was 72 years old who was diabetic and was a former heavy smoker. The same went with my mother, Loida Tobias, as well. She was 61, diabetic, dealt with hypertension, and was as susceptible to the virus as my father.  Over the span of a few weeks, my father's health began deteriorating and my mother used her vacation days to take care of my father. She's a nurse and naturally, she wanted to help our father and ensure that he would hopefully recover from this. However, with that, she inevitably caught the virus as well. This eventually would lead to the virus spreading to the rest of my family and we would be in poor shape for weeks. Unfortunately, my parents took the brunt of the virus and they eventually were hospitalized due to their conditions worsening. Although the chances were slim, my sister and I had hope that they would recover and eventually be discharged, but they, unfortunately, ended up passing. My father would pass away due to complications on May 30th, and my mother would pass away on June 30th.?My parents were amazing and lived exceptional lives. They grew up in their own impoverished homes back in the Philippines, but they always pursued higher education to be able to take care of their brothers, sisters, and their parents. Despite the conditions they were born and forced into, they managed to persevere and would receive their degrees at Far Eastern University in Manila. My mother received a degree to pursue a career in nursing, and my father would get a teacher's degree to study and teach physics. Eventually, my parents would meet and, as it goes, fell in love. My dad would then immigrate to the U.S. in 1990 to start a family with my mom and find new opportunities for themselves. My dad would eventually land a job as a bartender at the Windows of the World in the World Trade Center and my mom would also become a head nurse at Harlem Hospital Center. They would then have my sister in 1991 and have me in 2003.?My realization of my dreams came from inspiration from my parents, learning my true passions, and the discovery of what I wanted to pursue in my life. When I enter college, I want to study premed and go on to medical school to pursue a career as a neurosurgeon. However, with the passing of my parents, the security of my future is unclear because I don't have a source of income to help fund my education. Hopefully, with this fundraiser, I'll be able to help fund my first year of college while I work towards funding my own career. Any amount would definitely be appreciated and I genuinely thank you for reading this.Roberto Tobias JrNote: There has been people who are wondering about the beneficiary for my fundraiser. Pureza Capriles is actually my aunt and guardian who will be handling my funds for me. She?ôll ensure that the the funds will be directed towards housing, necessities, and most importantly, tuition. As I?ôm underaged, she must be the one to withdraw the funds for me. Sorry for the confusion.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a Los Angeles native, freelance creative media consultant, bookworm, and director of The Free Black Women's Library - Los Angeles (a Black feminist traveling book swap). Ever since I was a tiny, safehouses for me have been libraries and independent bookstores. In indie bookstores, I had the room as a Black girl to be brave with my curiosities, affirmed by characters in places I knew and wanted to know, and comfortable knowing I was surrounded by folks who, too, loved the community built around a good story. Through my work in launching + sustaining @thefreeblackwomenslibrary_la, I?ôve been able to create mini literary safehouses for us all throughout the city, lugging tubs of books in my car and cramming bags of craft supplies in my trunk to community centered businesses and museums who hosted us for little to nothing and loved on us more than I can express. It?ôs been a beautiful, humbling journey. It is far from over. Last fall, I began looking for spaces. It marked my first step in claiming the vision - a loving and inviting bookshop dedicated to prioritizing books, comics, and zines by and about Black women, girls, femmes, and non-binary folks. A resting ground. A brave space. A Black place. A quiet nook to visit and read and print after school. Somewhere for the babies to have storytime. A place to nerd out in and be cool in and feel loved. I been working on the vision - crunching the numbers, meeting with the realtor, planning with my contractor, designing mood boards, brainstorming programming, and praying. Nightly. Sometimes all throughout the day. It?ôs the dream I can?ôt shake and I?ôm rolling with it. It is sooo close. The Salt Eaters, is derived from Toni Cade Bambara?ôs book THE SALT EATERS that provided my first in depth, and, admittedly, destabilizing look into the murky waters of mental health for folks that looked like me and expanded my understanding of wholeness (?úno trifling matter??, interdependency, astrology, Black feminism, and beyond.

At the time, Mary was raising 3 young children (Ben, Rachel, and Joshua) and working part-time. Supported by her amazing husband, Jonathan Prier, and family, Mary endured extensive chemotherapy, radiation treatments and a mastectomy. This was all quite the shock, but Mary was resilient and came through the treatments with a clean bill of health.If you don?ôt personally know Mary, imagine one of the smartest, sweetest, nicest, and most amazing mothers and you will start to get an idea. If you already know Mary, she likely has made a memorable impact in your life. Mary grew up in Dayton, Ohio and attended St. Anthony Elementary (??8 Grad) and Chaminade-Julienne High School (??2 Grad). Mary obtained her bachelor?ôs degree from the University of Dayton (??6 Grad) and a master?ôs degree from the Ohio State University. She is active at her church (St. Matthew) in Gahanna, Ohio, and a wonderful person.After the chemotherapy and radiation, Mary?ôs likelihood of getting pregnant again was very low: and so it was a wonderful surprise to learn she was pregnant again in 2019. On Thursday, May 7th, 2020 Mary and Jonathon welcomed a miracle baby (Luke) to their family. Mom and baby were healthy and home from the hospital two days later on Saturday, May 9th. Everyone was happy and excited for this joyous life moment.All of this makes the next part of this story difficult to tell.On Tuesday, May 12th, Mary suffered a seizure at home and was temporarily unresponsive. Mary was rushed to the hospital and underwent an extensive work up including CT scans and MRIs. The tests revealed multiple lesions in her brain; and additional lesions in her liver and lung.? A biopsy from her liver revealed she has Stage 4 recurrent metastatic breast cancer.? She will undergo radiation and chemotherapy in the upcoming weeks and months.??Many family and friends are reaching out to help in any way possible; and Jon and Mary are very thankful for this support. A separate account has been set-up for the benefit of Mary?ôs 4 young children (Ages 8, 6, 4, and 1 week) and intended to help offset costs related to childcare and future education. Any contribution amount is truly appreciated. We hope this campaign will be a small token to show Mary and Jon they are not alone in this fight. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.

She encouraged workshop attendees to explore, and experience the cliff tops and rocky beaches, the ancient neolithic UNESCO world heritage sites, the howl of the North Sea, all helping participants understand the source and force behind what she was doing. (Mom's work sizzled with the elements of the landscape in which she was raised).???""My work is filled with images of nature, and I think that is due to the fact that I grew up surrounded by the ocean, birds in rocky cliffs, grassy hillsides, and the wind and the rain.""

To tackle the low literacy rates in the city, The X for Boys also has a weekly book club that's hosted every Monday for boys to attend after-school. It helps them with reading comprehension and vocabulary building. The boys also get to receive sex education and also have a place to release any stress or issues in a non-judgmental environment. The X for Boys has hosted 2 successful summer camps that King Randall did both years out of his home. Visit thexforboys.org to see videos!

The goal of this campaign is to raise funds to help the Parodi family cover medical expenses and to establish a college fund for Anthony's education because he WILL recover, he WILL go back to school and he WILL go to college in a couple years.?Anthony is no stranger to hospitals. He was born with a serious heart condition and he has endured countless surgeries since his birth. However, the last year has been exceptionally difficult for him and his family as his health deteriorated and his liver stopped functioning. Doctors placed him on the national wait list for both a heart and liver transplant, and for the past year, he has been patiently waiting for a donor to save his life. He has been unable to leave the hospital during the last six months because of his delicate condition. As a result of the pandemic, only one parent can accompany him in the hospital at a time and he has not been able to receive any visitors.An incredibly intelligent and kind young man who has always been an A student, Anthony is a big fan of comic books, Legos and Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds himself publicly invited him to be a part of the next Deadpool movie. Anthony has felt the love of his Belen brothers and his extended family during this difficult time. Anthony and his family are incredibly grateful for the love and support the Belen Jesuit community has given them during these past months along with so many others. During the 8/13 live broadcast of Univision?ôs Premios Juventud, one of the music awards shows his father production manages, the entire production crew gave Anthony a standing ovation and wished him a speedy recovery live, on-air. Immediately after his transplant surgery, an emergency blood drive organized for him at his parish broke records and was the biggest blood drive organized for any one recipient in Miami?ôs history. It goes without saying that Anthony is loved by many in the Miami community. Many who have been touched by him and/or by his family, who wish they could do more to help during this extremely difficult time.Needless to say, the Parodi family?ôs finances have been stretched very thin as a result of Anthony?ôs extended hospital stay and the serious complications that arose during the transplant surgery. The situation has been aggravated by the pandemic as Anthony?ôs father, Tony, works as a live event, concert & television producer, one of the industries most impacted by COVID. Anthony?ôs parents are mindful about everyone else?ôs own struggles during these unprecedented times and they are too selfless to ever ask for help; therefore, this campaign has been organized on their behalf. We have been overwhelmed by requests from friends, extended family and colleagues who want to help the Parodi Family in any way that they can??to give back in return for the countless ways in which Tony and Sonia have positively impacted their own lives. What better way to do so than with a donation to help secure Anthony?ôs future once he recovers?Anthony will recover. He will live a healthy, normal life. He will graduate Belen and he will go to college in a couple years. How amazing would it be for the Parodi family to have Anthony?ôs medical expenses covered, but also to be able to plan for college once he recovers, without having to worry about money? Let?ôs join together to help Tony, Sonia and Noella manifest Anthony?ôs recovery, celebrate his high school graduation and send him off to college healthy, happy and without any financial concerns.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is one of the lead science contacts for Hearts in the Ice.Citizen science is a term given to any project that involves public collaboration in contribution to scientific research. The goal is to engage the public and use the data collected to increase overall knowledge on a given subject.Citizen science has the power to transform science and society. We live in a time where technology and information and collaborate on research that can help us all better understand the impact our changing climate is having on our wildlife, micro-organisms in the water, air, and ice, weather systems and cultures and peoples around the world.""One of the challenges is that people find it difficult to connect to big-picture global data"", Damsgard adds. ?úCitizen science is a way to close the gap between people?ôs perception and scientists monitoring the climate changes.??The 20 sq mtrs Trappers cabin called "" Bamsebu"", home for Hilde and Sunniva for the year.What have Sunniva and Hilde been doing isolated and so far away from civilization for a year in the Arctic and why?We are leaders on the front lines and understand that we have powerful voices through which to share our findings with others. As two women who have spent decades exploring and working in the Polar Regions we felt that we could add value to our understanding of climate change.We could also test the limits of our skills and abilities by over-wintering (spending 3 months in complete darkness), collaborating with scientists (engaged in 7 citizen science projects), and being keen observers of wildlife (from Polar bears to belugas) to the changes up here in the Arctic over 9 months.The power of nature- it?ôs subtle sounds and how it all spins a story around the cycles of a season. We have developed a keen understanding around what we see. Changes that happen are a? result of adaptation. For example, polar bear hunting reindeer is not usual behaviour, yet it has happened! These stories help us to understand the bigger picture and these stories connect us all in this conversation around climate change.Our simple efficiency of living so closely to nature amplifies our thoughts, affects our daily choices and illuminates the challenges we all face as a species. We want to continue to help people around the world understand how important they are and how important their choices are ??every action creates a chain reaction.?What can you do to engage and make a difference?Anything that involves getting outside and observing nature can be turned into a citizen science project. All you need is a place, a question (what do you want to learn/observe?) and a desire to explore. There are endless opportunities for teachers to get their students involved, so here are some ideas for getting started:¬∑? ? ? Consider getting involved with one of the citizen science projects mentioned above, such as NASA?ôs GLOBE Observer? or the polar phytoplankton FjordPhyto project?.?¬∑? ? ?

Queste particolarit? fanno s√¨ che abbia quotidianamente bisogno di una persona qualificata in ambito infermieristico, nel caso di assenza del genitore (ormai addestrato per la gestione).I medici specialisti che lo seguono ritengono essenziale per il suo sviluppo cognitivo e relazionale un inserimento tempestivo nell?ôambiente scolastico insieme ai suoi coetanei.?Riccardo non ha per fortuna problemi neurologici (certificato dalla neuropsichiatria infantile) e non necessita quindi di un Assistente educatore, bens√¨ di un assistente sanitario che lo segua durante l?ôorario scolastico (Nido/Infanzia).?Il problema e??che non √® previsto nessun supporto,?al Nido e poco e niente praticamente per l?ôinfanzia, per la famiglia da parte dello Stato e quindi, se volessi comunque mandarlo a Scuola, tutte le spese sarebbero a carico esclusivo della famiglia.Vi chiedo quindi: che cosa posso fare per ovviare al mio problema??Mi rivolgo a Voi con la speranza che ci possiate aiutare con questa raccolta fondi per permettere a mio figlio il diritto di inclusione scolastica.?Un supporto economico che ci permetterebbe di far frequentare, al meglio e in sicurezza, la Scuola a Riccardo, senza gravare ancor di pi√π sulla nostra famiglia che gi? affronta quotidianamente spese consistenti per la gestione di un bambino ?úspeciale??come il nostro.Vi ringraziamo moltissimo per qualsiasi aiuto vogliate darci perch√© anche un piccolo contributo sar? un grande supporto per noi e per Riccardo!Vorrei sottolineare che i soldi andranno sul mio conto in quanto mamma di Riccardo ma verranno poi passati immediatamente sul conto personale di Riccardo visto che poi saranno usati esclusivamente per il suo inserimento a scuola!?Grazie veramente a tutti per l?ôaiuto!---My name is Barbara, Riccardo's mother, a ""Special"" baby born in April 2018 with Treacher-Collins syndrome (TSC). The syndrome manifests itself with facial dysmorphism (in practice the face appears deformed), a rare genetic disease that causes particular deformities and facial anomalies.Due to his particular syndrome, Riccardo is unfortunately forced to breathe through 'Tracheostomy' (a small hole in the trachea) and to eat via 'Peg' (direct feeding in the stomach). These particularities mean that he needs a qualified nursing person on a daily basis, in the absence of the parent (now trained for management).The specialist doctors who follow him believe that timely insertion into the school environment together with his peers is essential for his cognitive and relational development. Fortunately, Riccardo does not have neurological problems (certified by child neuropsychiatry) and therefore does not need an assistant educator, rather a health assistant who follows him during school hours (nursery / childhood). The problem is that no support is provided, at the nursery level and nothing practically for children, for the family by the state and therefore, if I still wanted to send him to school, all the expenses would be borne exclusively by the family.So I ask you: what can I do to remedy our problem? I turn to you with the hope that you can help us with this fundraiser to allow my child the right to school inclusion. An economic support that would allow Riccardo to attend school, in the best and safest way, without weighing even more on our family who already face substantial expenses every day for the management of a ""special"" child like ours.We thank you very much for any help you want to give us because even a small contribution will be a great support for us and for Riccardo!I would like to emphasize that the money will go to my account as Riccardo's mother but will then be passed immediately to Riccardo's personal account since they will then be used exclusively for his inclusion in school!

He turned 23 on May 31st, the day before his mother?ôs untimely death, and Philip turned 15 on June 2nd, the day after.Erica was a loving, sweet and kind person that would never hurt anyone. She lived life in a special way, always welcoming people of all walks of life, and treating her friendships unconditionally. Erica was a gentle and fragile soul who wanted to take care of everyone.However, her life took a tragic turn roughly 3 years ago when her husband, Lyndon, fell down a flight of stairs and suffered severe brain trauma. He is unable to spell his own name and at times he cannot even formulate a sentence. Unfortunately, he will never again be the man they once knew as their father.That fall left the kids without the father they knew and loved and they had to adjust quickly to a new way of life, with a Dad that was unable to play sports, bike ride, or ever walk again. On many days, he cannot even recognize them as his sons.His own memory of life as he knew it has been shattered.As parents, Lyndon and Erica made sure that Danny and Philip received the best education possible and taught them to be productive members of society and good human beings. Philip is currently enrolled in a fantastic school and his parents were unable to foresee a tragedy of this magnitude.With these events unfolding and all of the emotional stress even Love couldn?ôt sustain the bumps and turns.?As Lyndon, the provider for the family, was and still is unable to function due to his medical condition, the bills started to mount, income was scarce and the mortgages were due.This financial hardship and emotional trauma, took its toll on the children and especially, on Erica.Erica gave her all to care and provide for a man that was no longer the robust man she married: active, social and hardworking. He was bedridden and unable to perform the simplest of tasks, including feeding himself or going to the bathroom. Erica tried to be as strong as possible for herself and her children.Lyndon suffered seizures and was placed into a facility where he was able to receive the skilled help he needed.The last 3 years have been quite a battle; a battle on all levels, financial, emotional and spiritual. The financial burden has become an unsustainable spiral and the financial obligations continue to grow.?Our nephews now find themselves without parents to guide and support them and in the worst possible scenario.They are good boys, good souls and amazing future servants to society.With the loss of both parents and now their home about to be foreclosed on, they are left with monumental financial hardships and just the clothes on their backs. This has placed them in a delicate emotional, and financial state.Amongst some of their expenses are education, clothing, medical, transportation, daily expenses, food and no parental contributions to support them financially on this path.We, as their aunts and uncles will do all that we possibly can to support them the best we can.We understand that the current state of world affairs has many people struggling financially.However, if you are able to contribute, in any way, so that these boys can create a new beginning, a new life, and get the help they need to remain psychologically balanced, as well as meet their financial obligations it would be forever appreciated.No contribution is too small. Every bit counts.The old adage ?úit takes a village??is what it will take to ensure that our nephews Danny and Philip get the support they need to re- establish their lives and live a healthy, vibrant and emotionally stable existence.On behalf of the Beaman and Giocoli family we thank you, and we are all in this together!Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hotze, M.D.The socialist Democrat leadership in Harris County has developed a massive ballot by mail vote harvesting scheme to steal the general election. Ballot harvesting is a second-degree felony in Texas. ?We are working with a group of private investigators who have uncovered this massive election fraud scheme. County Commissioner Rodney Ellis is the Democrat leader of this criminal operation. He has two captains, Gerald Womack and Dallas Jones, who pay hundreds of ?úsoldiers??to illegally harvest ballots by mail from nursing homes, the homeless, the poor, students and even from those who have died. Our private investigators have been told by informants that the Democrats boast that they can get 700,000 illegal ballots by mail in Harris County alone.You can help us expose and stop this massive election fraud scheme by donating here at the Liberty Center for God & Country?ôs GoFundMe account.Liberty Center for God & Country is a 501(c)3 organization committed to standing up for our God-given, unalienable rights and liberties. It employs legal action to ensure that these rights and liberties are protected.? Donations are tax deductible.The socialist Democrats turned Harris County blue in the 2016 elections. In 2012, Obama and Romney were dead even in votes in Harris County, which has over 2.2 registered voters. In 2016, Trump lost to Hillary Clinton in Harris County by 140,000 votes, but carried Texas by 8 percentage points. In 2018, Cruz lost Harris County to Beto O?ôRourke by 200,000 votes, despite the fact that the polls showed that Cruz was ahead by 9 percentage points in Harris County. We now understand how this happened. The Democrats have been employing their massive ballot by mail vote harvesting scheme to steal elections. Prior to 2016, Harris County was the largest Republican County in the country, and yet Trump lost to Clinton here. This is amazing when you consider that Trump carried the Democrat controlled states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that same year.The Texas Biden campaign has hired Dallas Jones, the major Harris County vote harvester, to run Biden?ôs campaign in Texas.It is obvious that they hired Jones, so that the same illegal ballot by mail vote harvesting program could be used in other Texas??metropolitan areas and other counties controlled by the Democrats. This would include Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, Travis, and counties in the Valley. Unless this massive election fraud scheme is exposed and stopped, Texas will be turned blue and Trump will be defeated.As Harris County goes, so goes Texas. As Texas goes, so goes the country. Texas has 35 electoral votes.? If those votes are shifted from the Trump column to the Biden column, that is a swing of 70 electoral votes. It only takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidential election. You can help us expose and stop this massive election fraud scheme by donating here at the Liberty Center for God & Country?ôs GoFundMe account. Please consider giving $25, $50, $100, $500 or more to help us stop this voter fraud scheme.

He was having up to 100 per day and was put in a medically induced coma until the doctors at Riley could figure out what to do. Finally, after 3 weeks, he had a right frontal lobectomy ??removing the right frontal quadrant of his brain. The doctors were not sure the surgery would be successful, and it was the first surgery of its kind. The surgery was successful - he has not had any seizures since surgery - but it did leave him with many challenges. He is a bright young man, but his shine is hard to see due to the lack of executive functioning skills. He excels in math and science and loves to play chess, card games (pretty much wins every time!), enjoys nature (has been a beekeeper), and of course video games! Most people do not have to think about their executive functions??they are just a part of everyday life. Getting up in the morning, having breakfast, and getting ready for the day are just routine. For Dalton, these daily routines require many steps, guidance, and skills he does not have.Dalton has graduated from Fortune Academy, a school for children with learning differences, with a Core-40 diploma. We have been searching for a college program that can meet his needs. He is now 20 years old. We have looked into colleges that provide high levels of academic support but they do not provide the independent living and life skills which Dalton needs in order to be successful in college. We have also looked at assisted living/group home programs, but they tend to provide aid with daily living but do not provide education and/or career assistance. So, we are at a standstill. We finally found the College Internship Program in Bloomington, Indiana.?

Her story is one of incredible resilience, dedication, and compassion. It was Leigh's wish that her family and friends find a way to honor her death, and be truthful about her life--a life defined by overcoming addiction, and breaking away the stigmas associated with it by becoming a physician. By establishing this fund in her memory, our goal is to continue her unwavering efforts to change the perception of persons in recovery by sharing her story, just as she did throughout her own 13 years of recovery.?Our intention is for the memorial funds to go to individuals in recovery from addiction who attend Georgia Southern University and who are pursuing degrees in any health-related discipline or STEM field. This GoFundMe page will serve as a temporary fundraising space in hopes that we can raise a high enough sum for a permanent endowment at Georgia Southern University in Leigh's name.Please consider giving any amount you are able--as little or as great as that might be. If her story is shared far and wide just a small donation will go a long way to helping the next student carry out her legacy of breaking down barriers often tied to those in addiction recovery.??Donations will be mailed to the GSU Foundation through PayPal, Inc, earmarked in memory of Leigh to benefit students. ?Our minimum goal is $30,000, but we could make a much bigger difference in the lives of students with a $50,000 endowment.On April 14th, 2020, our dear friend Leigh Sundem took her own life when she succumbed to the pain of falling short of her dreams which she worked tirelessly for, and deserved on her merits alone. Everyone who knew this ambitious woman who overcame countless obstacles has been left with overwhelming grief and confusion.Leigh's struggle with alcoholism and drug addiction began in middle school when she started drinking to escape her feelings of depression and anxiety. It progressed quickly, and in a few short years she experienced swift consequences for her regular drug use when she spent her 16th birthday in a juvenile detention facility. Over the next few years, Leigh was in and out of the legal system while continuing to battle her addiction. This portion of her story is best told in her own words, which can be heard here when she fearlessly advocated for others in recovery in front of Congress ten years ago. https://www.c-span.org/person/?leighsundemIn 2007 while on parole, she rear-ended a Georgia State Patrol officer at a red light. She was given a choice to complete her 7-year prison sentence, or to enter a long-term treatment facility. This moment became the catalyst for her journey to recovery. She chose to go to Statesboro, Georgia where she spent over two years in an intensive addiction treatment program. While working at minimum-wage food service jobs to help pay for treatment, she began to realize her incredible potential and she began to dream. She dreamt of ways that she could give back to people in need. Early in recovery, she decided to pursue a medical degree and help as many people as possible along the way. With her goal in mind, she became dedicated to overcoming and rectifying her mistakes as a teen and young adult.?She realized that to be successful she would need to build a support system and a network of accountability. With these as a foundation, she hoped to demonstrate that investing in a person who has recovered from a substance-use disorder is not a liability, but an asset. During that time, she became an outspoken advocate and ally for those fighting addiction. From 2008-2012, she became a member of the founding class of students in Georgia Southern's Center for Addiction Recovery (CAR). At that time, there were only a handful of programs like it in the country. One of the Center?ôs primary missions is to help students like Leigh have an opportunity to obtain a college degree with resources to assure relapse-prevention and academic success. College life has been described by many scholars as an abstinence-hostile environment, and the CAR program was exactly the support program she needed to overcome the unique challenges that she would face.With this newfound motivation and determination, and with the support of her recovery networks, she became one of the most well-known graduates from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Leigh graduated in 2012 summa cum laude from the University Honors program at Georgia Southern University. She scored in the 99th percentile on her Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), one of the highest scores ever reached at the University. She immediately entered The University of Rochester School of Medicine to pursue a medical degree with the eventual goal of becoming an orthopedic surgeon. By the time she graduated from her program, Leigh also became recognized as an outstanding researcher. She was awarded multiple research awards and fellowships during her tenure at the University of Rochester (for brief overview, click here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/leighsundem).When it came time to match with a residency, Leigh had done everything possible to reach her dream. She had always been open and honest about her journey to recovery, she exemplified how her past was an asset and not a liability, and she participated in a voluntary monitoring program for 12 years to prove that she was serious about her recovery. However, many programs were unwilling to admit anyone with a criminal record involving drugs and alcohol. Leigh was devastated when she failed to match into any orthopedic surgery programs. Never complacent, she quickly found a surgical preliminary position at Rutgers University and began working towards securing a residency in Emergency Medicine the next year.When the second year of matching came, Leigh again felt confident that she would match with a program. Her time at Rutgers had resulted in further accomplishments and accolades. She now garnered new skills, exceptional recommendations, and a growing network of peers and professionals willing to advocate for her. During this time she was also asked to write about her years of volunteering and her persistent work with those struggling with substance-use disorders. While she seemed like an obvious asset for most programs combating the opioid epidemic, she did not match into any Emergency Medicine programs.?Over the next year, Leigh tried to remain optimistic, but began expressing regret at having missed out on so many milestones her friends were experiencing (careers, marriages, babies). She found herself feeling increasingly isolated as she struggled to maintain her closest relationships due to her demanding schedule. And yet she still supported her friends as much as she could. When she showed up, she brought joy and encouragement. She also continued to share her story of recovery whenever speaking engagements allowed. As she tried to balance her career, family and friends, and being a resource for others in need, she was also planning out her next move. In March of 2020, after again failing to match for the third year into a residency program, she was completely devastated. In Leigh's eyes, she would never secure a job in medicine at the level she aspired. After dedicating her life to recovery from addiction and to the field of medicine, this last rejection left her hopeless.Leigh's?presence was larger than life and has left an emptiness in the hearts of those she left behind. ?She was a woman who never shied away from the truth of who she was and stood tall as the woman she had become--not the girl who made mistakes as a child. Most incredible of all was that she never turned down an opportunity to help anyone who needed hope that there was life after addiction.Leigh was an amazing daughter, sister, friend, and colleague. We will forever remember her bold friendship, the late night conversations, the car ride sing-a-longs, the lectures, the brash honesty, our study buddy, and her incredibly resilient spirit. She was the best of us, and we hope that you have been moved by her story and will consider donating to support the dreams of the young people who will come after her to stand on the shoulders of our beloved trailblazer.In conversations, Leigh often ended with ""Love you, mean it"".So, from Leigh's Team,We Love You, Mean it!An excerpt of Leigh's story, which she and others shared in jails and prisons all over the country:""If you work hard and stay focused on what you're passionate about there is a life waiting for you outside these walls that will be bigger and better than you ever could have imagined on your own. Never give up hope. When you're finally released, apply the same work ethic, the same focus, and the same passion into everything you do""-Leigh Sundem?Memorials may also be given in honor of Leigh Sundem by check to:?Georgia Southern University Foundation, Inc.(Memo line:?

That wasn?ôt the menu because it was a very special day, that was the menu because it?ôs Tony Minette.? So who is this consumer of gourmet meats?? Tony Minette is a kid from Frankfort, IL.? He was raised by his loving mother, Debbie, and father, Big Tony, along with his sisters Anna and Aimee.? He was survived by his loving wife Holli and their three beautiful children in Haley, Anthony IV and Dominic.? He grew up in an environment full of love, family and friends and carried that forward through his own family.? Throughout his youth he was a kid that loved sports, meeting up with his friends, playing in the pool, running through screen doors (?), hosting card nights and driving Chevy Cavaliers.? That?ôs right ??Tony had a Cavalier with neon lights all the way around the undercarriage and with two 12??subwoofers in the trunk.? He took it off-roading once and shattered all the neons.? Divine intervention, perhaps.? Tony didn?ôt just love Cavaliers.? ?He loved his wife Holli, his children, sisters, mother, father, and his entire (massive) extended family, his friends from grade school, his friends from high school, his brothers at Pi Kappa Alpha and college friends, his friends from work, his huge group of friends turned family in FL, and so many more.? He loved spending time with his family, cooking for others (the more the merrier), using the NFL as an excuse to eat and sit on a couch all day, the Cubs, bowling (especially with his father), fishing, playing poker, music, dancing, Italian horns, wearing a Bluetooth device while not on a call and the use of ?úno problem??What?ôs amazing about Tony is that the friends he made in the 80?ôs and 90?ôs remain his friends today, along with a whole slew along every step of the way.?

His ability to see the best in people, find ways to relate and genuinely engage, listen and care for everyone he interacted with.? The number of lives he participated in and positively affected was remarkable.? However, Tony?ôs story recently changed.One day in February 2020, Tony was driving and experienced impaired vision in his right eye.? Tony was very young and healthy, surely this was no big deal.? What started as an ordinary day turned into a trip to the eye doctor that turned into weeks of multiple specialists before his condition was understood.? The day that started like any other day turned into a diagnosis of stage 4 cancer.?? Despite an infinite amount of love, prayer, support and treatment strategies, Tony?ôs cancer would not listen to our pleas and quickly spread throughout his body.? Just 8 months after another ordinary day, Tony lost his life to a disease that has claimed the life of too many of our loved ones.? Tony accomplished many things in life, in far too short an amount of time, and there was so much more for him to do, memories for him to create, love for him to share.? Tony?ôs story and dreams do not end with his tragic passing.? On a sunny Florida day in late September, Tony and a friend went to one of his favorite places, the grocery store.? After walking through the butcher section and thoroughly describing what he would do with each cut, there was a discussion about what he wanted to accomplish yet in life.? There was not one personal indulgence, Tony talked about his family and his goal of establishing college funds for his children.? The monies raised through this effort will go directly towards helping establish college funds (529s) for Tony?ôs sons Anthony IV and Dominic while supporting his daughter Haley?ôs current college tuition expense.? Tony?ôs wife Holli will take direct ownership of the funds and will receive our assistance in establishing the 529s.? Holli is an amazing woman who supported her husband and children through the most challenging times imaginable, and with our help she can carry forward his legacy in support of their children?ôs futures.??

387,Keep Roxbury-Weston Pre-K Alive!,"Created June 17, 2020",Education & Learning,"$50,000 ","$46,629 ",257,984,246,"In these times of reflection, confrontation, and growth, I have taken time to look back in my life and appreciate the experiences that have been most impactful in shaping the person I am today. Throughout my life, I have never struggled to be open to sharing moments with people who do not look like me. I realize that my openness roots itself in many different sources, such as being a part of a multi-cultural household, and my parents' views, but one program particularly stands out in beginning my journey stepping across racial and cultural bounds.?The Roxbury Weston Preschool program began in 1966, when METCO was established in Weston Public Schools (WPS), and there was a need to prove Boston based students could meet the requirements of entering Kindergarten. RoxWes began operating with the purpose of bringing diversity earlier to the community and ensuring METCO kids would be better prepared for WPS. Around this time, the Weston School Committee agreed to provide its bus service to bring the Boston students to school each day. Unfortunately, this cost is no longer being covered by WPS, jeopardizing this incredible program. If they are not able to raise funds for the bus, they risk not being able to operate this program for much longer. They need our help. I recently wrote a piece about my experiences as a?token black friend, which went viral. Since then, I haven't stopped receiving messages of support and affirmation. I am asking all of you to help me by contributing to this fundraiser.?If my story meant something to you, here is where it began.?From the age of three to five, I attended Roxbury Weston Preschool. Its mission is to bring families together in a learning community dedicated to the celebration of diversity and excellence in early care and education. It was here that I made my first white friends. It was here that I had my first play date in a suburb after school. It was here that I first learned that I was black, and that began facing questions about my identity, albeit at the level I could understand then. Most importantly, it was here that my outlook in this different community was formed, and attitudes of acceptance were fostered.?Equally, these same firsts occurred for my white friends at the school with a person of color from the inner city. I reached out to one of my lifelong friends, Josh White, who shared the RoxWes experience with me, asking for his reflections. His thoughts are included below, and I believe they speak directly to the impact the program has on the Weston students as much as the Boston kids.?_____________________________________________________________________________________""While I don?ôt remember every specific moment from my time at Roxbury Weston, I remember seeing my classmates?îregardless of race or socioeconomic background?îmerely as friends with whom I enjoyed learning, recess time, and playdates. Attending Roxbury Weston in my early, formative years enabled me to break through Weston?ôs predominately-white bubble and garner a more diverse outlook at just four years old. What?ôs more, my time at Roxbury Weston initiated lifelong friendships with my Roxbury classmates, such as Ramesh Nagarajah, and their families. I cherish my lifelong relationship with Ramesh, an incredibly accomplished friend I greatly respect and might not have met without Roxbury Weston.Throughout the majority of my life, I had thought that my acceptance of and ability to make friends with individuals of all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds were innate traits. But childhood psychology tells us that these traits must be reinforced, and that children develop them throughout their early years. Roxbury Weston gave me an early exposure to the diverse perspectives of my classmates and allowed me to form friendships which, although I may not have realized at the time, left an indelible mark on me and my perspective of others. Throughout the many years since attending Roxbury Weston, these attributes have made me a stronger classmate, teammate, and coworker. While I?ôm not claiming to have it all figured out, I can say with certainty that my time at Roxbury Weston was pivotal in shaping the person I am today.""_______________________________________________________________________________________Thanks for checking this out, and thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me. With the network this can reach, I am hoping to raise enough to cover the bus for multiple years.

It has been more of a struggle now for him, he was terminated from his job, lost his health benefits & now only has his unemployment income to live on, while trying to support 3 people & the responsibilities that come with maintaining a home, & he is reaching out for support in this trying time of his life.Rinaldo is the head of the household who took care of his parents both financially & physically. He made a solemn promise to his parents, before the tragedy of losing both of them that he would make sure to take care of the household, be the provider and caretaker for his 2 sisters, 1 of who is afflicted with mental disabilities, who reside with him in his home. If losing both parents in less than a years time wasn?ôt enough to bear, Rinaldo is also dealing with another tragedy that involves his brother in law Eddie, who he considers to be not only his in law, but also a very good friend that Rinaldo could always rely on and who was like a son to Elisa and Giuseppe. The day after Rinaldo?ôs mother passed away, Eddie was admitted into the hospital & was diagnosed with the Covid-19. He was in the ICU on a ventilator fighting for his life & on Tuesday morning, April 21st, his wife & children were faced with making the hardest decision in their life and that was giving the doctors consent to amputate his right leg from below the knee down in order to save his life and not have the possibility of complications of more blood clots forming & going to his heart or brain & interfering with him trying to combat the most important & serious issue, giving him a fighting chance to come out of this & be rid of this evil disease, so that he may go home to his family, ( his wife Carol(my sister), & their children),who are devastated & full of grief, what makes it even harder is that they were unable to be by his side through all of what is happening to him. They prayed for him to come back home. Sadly on April 26th, Eddie succumbed to Covid. He fought to the end. His family are shocked & heartbroken. Rinaldo has now made it his duty to assist & provide, not only emotional but financial as well for his sister & nephews. Rinaldo is a prominent businessman who sits on the board of various charities, most of which focus on children & the elderly, who are forgotten by many. He?ôs main interest & goal in life has been to advocate the need for the care or lack of for the elderly, to listen to them, take the time to pay attention & assist them with a soothing voice, comforting touch & gentle heart. He holds a special place in his heart for the elderly, this has only escalated over the years as he became the caretakers for his parents.. He was the one that literally carried them & secured them in his vehicle, so he could transport them to their doctors appointments, he was the one that spent countless days & nights living in the hospital with them for months, he was the one that always made sure to have all necessary medical assistance they required, all while making sure his parents were always safe, comfortable & well taken care of. Rinaldo was not only their son, he was their pillar of strength that always set aside is own needs & made theirs his number one priority. Anyone that knows Rinaldo, knows that he is always there for everyone, no matter what the situation, without hesitation, no questions asked, he will run to your aid in a heartbeat.

A future is secured for the Tarras Valley nature reserveWe really can't ever thank everyone enough who made this possible! The response to this project has been unbelievable. Thank you to everyone that donated, shared, talked about this project and it's positive vision. We hope to welcome you to the Tarras Valley Nature Reserve soon!We now have to undertake the actual sales process which will take several months. There is a lot to do! It will take us a little time to get everything organised to we thank you in advance for your patience and we will contact everyone.Our efforts will also continue to secure the remaining 5,300 acres. In due course, we will contact Bronze, Silver, and Gold Donors about their respective awards. Full press release below!The South of Scotland?ôs largest community buyout is set to go ahead following one of the most ambitious community fundraising campaigns ever seen ??with the community of Langholm in Dumfries and Galloway raising the final funds needed in the nick of time.A?landmark community buyout agreement of ¬£3.8 million for over 5,000 acres of land?has been reached between The Langholm Initiative charity and Buccleuch ??paving the way for the creation of a huge new nature reserve to help tackle climate change, restore nature, and support community regeneration.Discussions will continue over the remaining 5,300 acres of land the community has expressed an interest in buying.Benny Higgins, Executive Chairman of Buccleuch, said: ?úWe?ôre absolutely delighted to have reached a significant agreement with The Langholm Initiative, and this deal demonstrates what can be achieved when everyone involved is committed to working together. The community has done a tremendous job in raising the funds to make this historic acquisition, and the plan to create a nature reserve has attracted widespread support. We wish the project every success.?úEngaging constructively with the communities in which we operate as a business is important to us. We have a long-standing policy of reducing our overall footprint to enable us to invest in other projects, and will continue this policy of selling land to interested farmers, community bodies and organisations which express an interest.?ùMargaret Pool, Chair of The Langholm Initiative, said: ?úThis is an amazing result for Langholm which will live long in the memory. Our community has a strong cultural connection to this land, which has never been sold before, and securing it for generations to come means so much to so many. Huge thanks to Buccleuch for their positive engagement.?ùRoseanna Cunningham, Cabinet Secretary for Environment and Land Reform, said: ?úThe completion of The Langholm Moor project is a momentous moment for land reform in Scotland. The project secured a ¬£1 million Scottish Land Fund grant in June, and it is of great testament to The Langholm Initiative that they have secured additional funding, and worked collaboratively with Buccleuch Estates, to bring 5,000 acres of land into community ownership. I commend both The Langholm Initiative and Buccleuch Estates for enabling the buy-out to be completed.?úThis is significant news for the South of Scotland but also demonstrates that, when working together with a shared goal, local communities can be a power vehicle for change. I applaud the Initiative wholeheartedly for realising their ambition and look forward to it inspiring other community groups to drive and deliver their own projects right across the country.?ùThe purchase ??to be finalised by January 2021 ??will lead to the creation of the Tarras Valley Nature Reserve, with globally important peatlands and ancient woods restored, native woodlands established, and a haven ensured for wildlife including rare hen harriers. The project will also support community regeneration, including through plans for the community to capitalise on new nature-based tourism opportunities.The Langholm Initiative had until 31 October to raise the funds for a deal, to avoid the Scottish Land Fund withdrawing their ¬£1 million offer ??a proviso that left the community with just months to raise millions of pounds. At times during the summer, the project appeared to be seriously at risk.In the run-up to the deadline, Buccleuch Estates and The Langholm Initiative agreed a revised ¬£3.8 million price for the purchase.With The Langholm Initiative still requiring substantial funding in the final weeks, ¬£500,000 was secured from the Bently Foundation. Camille Bently, Director of the Bently Foundation, said: ?úThe Bently Foundation is delighted to support this community-led environmental project. We wish them every success and look forward to visiting the new Tarras Valley Nature Reserve in future.?ùDuring the final week, an extraordinary surge of more than ¬£50,000 donations to the charity?ôs public crowdfunder ??including ¬£24,000 on one day alone ??saw the appeal?ôs ¬£200,000 target achieved. Nearly 4,000 people have supported the crowdfunding appeal since its launch on 7 May.In the final 48 hours before the deadline, and with the community still some ¬£150,000 short of the total funds needed, The Woodland Trust agreed to contribute ¬£200,000 to the project ??taking The Langholm Initiative over the line.Carol Evans, Director of Woodland Trust Scotland, said: ?úWe are thrilled to support The Langholm Initiative?ôs exciting plans with a financial contribution and help deliver new native woods set in an appropriate mosaic of other habitats at Langholm. The world faces a climate emergency and a biodiversity crisis. This initiative is a fightback against both threats.?ùJohn Watt, Scottish Land Fund Committee Chair, said: ?úThis is a momentous day for The Langholm Initiative and the wider community, who have pulled together and worked extremely hard over recent months to meet their fundraising goal. On behalf of the Scottish Land Fund, a huge congratulations to everyone involved. We are proud to be able to support them with a ¬£1 million award that will contribute to their exciting community ownership plans.?ùLangholm Initiative project leader Kevin Cumming said: ?úThe support for our vision has been overwhelming. We can never thank the major donors and thousands of members of the public enough for their contributions. A team of dedicated people have worked tirelessly to achieve something special here ??mostly volunteers, who continued to strive to make this happen against what at times felt like impossible odds.?úCommunity ownership can be a catalyst for regeneration, which we want to show can be done with the environment at its heart. We hope the success here will encourage and inspire other communities in Scotland and across the UK. Realizing the full potential of community ownership will take time ??and the hard work is really just about to begin.?ùOther major funders to the buyout include South of Scotland Enterprise, John Muir Trust, Carman Family Foundation, and Garfield Weston Foundation.Other leading charities that have supported the buyout include Borders Forest Trust, Rewilding Britain, RSPB Scotland, Scottish Wildlife Trust, and Trees for Life.The Langholm Initiative, formed in 1994 as one of south Scotland?ôs first development trusts, facilitates projects making a lasting difference to the local area and people.

396,Grow a Young Black Farmer in Minnesota,"Created July 24, 2020",Environment,"$365,000 ","$95,002 ",1.1K,2.8K,1.1K,"(photo ¬© Adja Gildersleve?)My name is Lizy Bryant. I am a queer, Black, emerging land steward born and raised in Minnesota. I am fundraising $365,000 to buy 25 acres of land and farming infrastructure an hour outside of the Twin Cities, which will be converted into an agricultural and artistic resource for Black Minnesotans and their families. When fully operative, this land will function as a farm, a gathering place, a learning facility, and a generative nexus for wellness and creativity.?There is an incredible healing potential inherent to this place: 400-year-old oaks, rolling hills, a flowing creek, and a rich diversity of wildlife. This land also houses two barns, a cheese plant, a milk house, a shed, and a two-story home. For the past 25 years, this farm has been cared for by my aunt, Lynne Reeck, who has practiced farming that is nurturing and responsive to the land?ôs needs. She has also worked to reinforce the strength and interconnection of local economies through her business, Singing Hills Goat Dairy, which produces some of Minnesota?ôs finest fresh milk goat cheese.Intentions:?1. Agricultural practices will honor a nurturing model of farming, which holds care as the standard, and the health of the land and the community as the goal.2. Space will be created and maintained for individual and collective artistic practice, allowing for creativity from a place of gratitude for the land and one another.?This land will be used as a space of healing and interconnection for Black Minnesotans and their families, who may come for retreats, refuge, and relationship building.3. This project will carry forward the established business of Singing Hills Goat Dairy, providing an earned income stream that supports upkeep of the land and programming. This will also facilitate training opportunities for Black emerging land stewards passionate about food production and local economies. There are ongoing efforts to explore additional revenue streams that complement a regenerative philosophy. This land has successfully supported tart cherries, hazelnuts, bees, elderberries, pastured pork, and apple trees?îsome of the many food crops that could be produced here.The overarching intention is for this farm to grow as one of many stewarded by emerging farmers of color in Minnesota. There is a massive, impending transition of land as baby boomer farmers retire. This is an exciting opportunity to redistribute land on a larger scale, especially to people of color who have experienced a rupture between their homelands and cultures in the name American imperialism. It is our ancestral knowledge, our histories of survival, and our creativity that are essential in healing a human connection to the earth.History:My aunt Lynne is this land?ôs most recent caretaker, and she has tended to this place in ways that are radical by contemporary standards. With that said, her approach is not novel. It extends from thousands of years of indigenous traditions that saw the land as a relative, and regarded physical and spiritual wellness as interconnected among beings. Up until the 19th century, the modern delineation of Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and the Ojibwa. In the 1800s, these tribes were forcibly removed, massacred or otherwise relegated to endure violent institutions of white assimilation. Simultaneously, the forced labor of enslaved Africans?îas well as the use of agricultural knowledge that they carried from their homelands?îhad been violently exploited for hundreds of years. The institutions of American slavery and indigenous genocide are intertwined. They are foundations of capitalism, forged by white settlers and fortified by the United States government. This system has overseen the catastrophic decline of the environment, in line with our individual and collective wellness. It is impossible to express the depths of these ruptures in a few sentences, but their legacies are all around us.According to a 2017 Census of Agriculture, 6.8% of Minnesotans identify as African-American or Black but comprise 0.03% of Minnesota farmers. Comparatively, 84.1% of Minnesotans identify as white, yet they make up 99.16% of the state's farmers. The numbers for other non-white populations mirror this trend, with the statistics for Black farmers exhibiting the most extreme disparity. There are so many enthusiastic emerging Black farmers and farmers of color in Minnesota who are thinking expansively about how to tend to land ethically and feed people equitably! It?ôs thrilling to witness and be a part of. Access to land is the greatest barrier to these stewards fully enacting their visions. This project will be truly successful when it is interconnected with the work of these stewards, farms and collectives, so that we may reinforce one another, share resources, and improve our practices collectively, on behalf of the whole. Budget: $365,0001. $336,000 will pay for the land, farming infrastructure, and the business. This comprises 25 acres, two barns, one milk house and cheese plant, one shed, and a two-story home. Singing Hills' current dairy operations support a living wage for 1.5 employees, with potential to grow. Additionally, all investments in the current business, including cheesemaking equipment, fencing, paddocks and water lines, as well as a loyal and significant customer base built over 12 years, will be transferred to the next stewards. Like most farms in the USA, Singing Hills Dairy is mortgaged. We intend to start mortgage free.2. $9,000 will fund an 8-month land transfer period, which will allow smooth and ethical transfer of ownership and knowledge, and prepare the space for what comes next. $6,000 will provide income for Lizy as she apprentices Lynne full time from September 2020 to April 2021, in cheesemaking, small business operations, and animal husbandry, as well as in learning about the unique qualities of this land and how to tend to it. $3,000 will fund paid consultations with a financial adviser, specialists in cooperative structures, and community outreach, including paid consultation with the Black farmers, local food justice community leaders, local tribal elders, and reimbursement for travel should any of the above be able to visit the farm. 3. $20,000 will fund critical infrastructural improvements to the home and one barn. For the house, it would fund updated heating and insulation, as well as new windows on the second floor for energy efficiency during the winter months. For the barn, it would fund a new roof to house hay for the goats.This project on these 25 acres is a small part of a much greater shift that returns land to Black people and people of color in Minnesota and globally. Alternative models of living and creating collectively are part of what will make our humanity possible?îfor us and for future generations.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many have visited Mayantuyacu to heal and learn. Even more have been served his medicine by students spread out around the world. The Mayantuyacu ""plantenna"" is far and wide, and at it's source is a humble teacher, his family, and the many workers needed to keep the healing center running year round. When the pandemic swept the globe, Peru was hit hard. The spread of Covid-19 cases in Peru is severe, including Pucallpa, the nearest city to Mayantuyacu. The country has been in lock-down since late March and respite is not in sight. We are asking you to help support Mayantuyacu while it is shuttered due to the pandemic.? Maestro Flores is the guardian of the sacred boiling river that flows through Mayantuyacu and he is a protector of the Amazonian rainforest. The plants teach us gratitude and humility, and now is the time to put these teachings into practice by giving back to Mayantuyacu. Funds raised will help the center cover monthly costs and sustain Mayantuacyu's role in nurturing and protecting the surrounding forest. Mayantuyacu is critical for the world's healing. I can't stress enough how important it is to support the centre and Maestro Flores through these times. Please give what you can, and if down the road you can contribute again, please do.

One night, over some beers we knew would end up at the dump unless we did something about it, we hatched a plan to combat this problem. Specifically, we wanted a system that was transparent, accessible, and most importantly, actually recycled glass into something functional. Instead of trying to take on the unrealistic task of reforming the current system, we decided to look at the glass half full by implementing our own grassroots glass recycling program. What We DoWe collect NOLA?ôs glass and recycle it into sand and glass cullet for disaster relief, coastal restoration, eco-construction, new glass and so much more. Our Impact:(1) Divert glass waste from landfills, creating a circular economy of usable products that benefit our community and environment.(2) Reinvest in Louisiana by producing sand critical to coastal restoration, disaster relief, eco-construction, and new glass products.(3) Educate and engage New Orleanians to collectively address our state?ôs inadequate recycling system?ì‚ÄìLouisiana currently ranks 50th nationally for percentage of municipal waste recycled.What This Fundraiser Lets Us Accomplish- Build the first glass recycling processing facility in Louisiana and launch the first crowd-funded, grassroots recycling facility in the world.Invest in systems and technology with the capacity to process all of Louisiana's glass. - Create a proof of concept for a closed-loop system where glass waste is converted into sand aimed at restoring coasts.- Radically transform the recycling industry into one motivated by environmental sustainability, not profit.Our ChallengesCurrently, we execute our process by hand?ì‚Äìfrom sorting bottles and shredding cardboard to transporting tens of thousands of pounds of glass between facilities. We require the machinery necessary to automate our process and scale operations in order to achieve our vision of taking on the post-consumer glass of not just New Orleans, but the entire state of Louisiana.We Need Your HelpWe truly cannot do this without you. Please join us in transforming Louisiana from last place in municipal waste recycling to a global leader as we show the world that we can reinvent our broken recycling system. Why you should support usWe have already demonstrated that the people of New Orleans want a glass recycling program and that we can successfully create sand and cullet from their glass. Most recently, we collected 15,000 pounds of glass in one day at our drop-off hub. We have created hundreds of sandbags and distributed them across the city. Now, we are ready to take our project to the next level with a more efficient machine to effectively recycle New Orleans' glass.?Franziska is the engineer, Max is the businessman, Ben is the process manager, and we are backed by hundreds of friends, family members, students, and TikTok followers. You could not invent a better team to tackle this problem in New Orleans. We are energized, smart, and tired of waiting for other people to make this planet a better place. The time is now to make glass recycling available to our entire city.?Our team has been working all day, every single day of the week to make this dream a reality. We just need one more push to get our operations up to scale. That?ôs where you come in!? ?Where your money will go:The funds raised by this campaign will be used to purchase a new glass pulverizing machine ($32,000) in order to meet our city?ôs recycling demands. We also need to purchase a used box truck ($15,000) to pick up residential glass and/or cardboard from around the city and transport your glass from our uptown hub to our processing facility in eastern Nola. Additionally, moving tons of glass by hand is no easy task. We need to purchase a front-end loader ($32,000) in order to be able to effectively move glass from intake to processing and then out to packaging. If this campaign exceeds our wildest dreams, we will purchase the larger ($62,000) glass pulverizing machine and a used trash truck ($20,000) in addition to the box truck to be used solely for residential and commercial glass and/or cardboard pickups. We will also purchase a tub grinder ($30,00) in order to effectively grind and compost the cardboard and paper we receive with residential glass.??*Please note that Glass Half Full is an L3C organization and does not currently have tax-exempt status.

This has left the country in a dire situation, one that we aim to help correct.Today, charcoal is still the main source of fuel for the country, especially within households for cooking and heating. This dependency has resulted in explosive planting of quick-growing, non-native trees to meet the ever-increasing demand. While introducing cleaner energy sources, such as solar power, is the ideal solution, due to financial constraints, charcoal is still the most affordable and prevalent option. Thus, to meet the Ugandan people where they are at, the first step we will take in reversing the trend of rapid deforestation for energy is to make the harvesting and use of charcoal as efficient as possible.PROGRAM SPECIFICS - REFORESTATIONPartnering with Gulu-based, sustainable reforestation experts, Kijani Forestry, we plan to plant over 20,000 trees across 50 acres.?^Photo of a portion of the land dedicated for the treesThe tree types planted include local-variety avocados, mangoes, papayas, oranges, and energy-efficient charcoal trees. Each species of tree is non-invasive, and by allocating a variety of tree types across our land, we will maintain biodiversity and soil integrity.?Concerning charcoal trees, they will be of local species which will not harm soil health. To promote sustainable farming practices, we will be utilizing a coppicing technique to plant charcoal trees. Coppicing is a forestry method in which the trees that are planted are those that will sprout from their stumps once cut down, creating a continuous wood source without frequently disturbing the soil.The charcoal we plan on producing will be created using carbon-efficient practices, producing similarly carbon-efficient charcoal. Therefore, as students practice their sales skills, they will introduce environmentally-safer charcoal into communities to reduce the rate of carbon emission from household cooking.?Beyond selling the fruit or charcoal harvested from the trees, the school will be able to develop a seed bank from which seeds can be sold to other farmers in the area, providing an opportunity for the students to witness how one item can have multiple methods to generate income.?MORE ABOUT SBVTC?At the peak of the Lord?ôs Resistance Army civil war, thousands of children were abducted, many of them girls who were forced into servitude. At the end of the war, these young girls returned home, having missed their childhood, formal education, and many of them with young children in tow. In response, SBVTC was founded in 2007 to support and educate the child mothers and girls who had been kidnapped during this dark, two-decade war, providing them with the knowledge and support needed to persevere and rise above their circumstances.?At SBVTC we are committed to educating and empowering individuals across the Acholi region to propel Northern Uganda, and the country as a whole, forward with modern innovation. Through our strong curriculum, practical training, and connections in the community, we provide students with skills needed to excel in their jobs, start their own businesses, and make a lasting impact on their community.?SBVTC aims to make education available to all students by breaking down barriers to education. With tuition costs often preventing students from attending school, we hope to alleviate that concern by being one of the few vocational schools in the country to offer tuition support. This will come in the form of completing work at the school and offering other forms of direct scholarships. We also offer childcare support for those students that need to attend school with young children.PROGRAM SPECIFICS - FEMALE EMPOWERMENT THROUGH ENTREPRENEURSHIP?Through classroom teaching followed by hands-on experience, the students of SBVTC will gain valuable entrepreneurship skills which they will be able to utilize in their lives far beyond their time in school.Traditional gender roles in Uganda often lead to women being limited to domestic jobs in households. This initiative will empower the female students of SBVTC to take control of their own futures through practical lessons in planting crops and taking their products to market to earn a living.Specifically, the students will learn from experienced teachers how to plant, tend to, and harvest from a variety of trees in a sustainable manner. They will then be taught valuable marketing and sales techniques to sell their products locally and abroad. Upon the completion of this training, the students will be able to individually support profitable, sustainable agroforestry endeavors, thus empowering them to be future change makers in their communities, sharing with community leaders and members the knowledge they learned at SBVTC and serving as an inspirational role-model for younger girls.Furthermore, throughout the program, students will learn about Uganda?ôs deforestation crisis and understand how their work at SBVTC contributes to a greener future for the country. By witnessing and participating in the TREES Initiative, SBVTC students will transform into fluent advocates for environmental preservation.TIMELINEPresent: Our team is consulting a diverse group of experienced experts at successful NGOs to design a curriculum which educates students about entrepreneurship. While based on agroforestry products, we hope to create a curriculum that can be applied to a variety of industries based on our students??home community needs.September - November 2020: Soil assessment will be conducted to confirm viability of selected tree species and land will be cleared and prepared for our reforestation program.?November 2020 - February 2021: Program Managers from SBVTC will travel to the urban center of Gulu for formal training with our expert partner, Kijani Forestry. There, they will learn the essentials of agroforestry, tree nursery operations, carbon-efficient charcoal production, and, most importantly, how to properly transfer this knowledge to students maintaining the saplings and trees.?March 2021: Saplings from Kijani Forestry will be delivered to SBVTC. Students will have received prior classroom instruction on topics such as how to properly space and plant the trees, allowing them to apply this knowledge during the actual transplanting process with guidance from Program Managers and Kijani.??Afterward: As the trees mature, students will harvest the fruit. Students will then use the produce to learn about value-adding processes and practice entrepreneurial skills such as marketing and sales. Additionally, the profit the students earn will help them pay for their tuition while at SBVTC.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
403,Protecting Curricabark,"Created October 18, 2020",Environment,"$120,000 ","$41,497 ",594,1.4K,567,"Aussie Ark has been fighting against the foreseeable demise of many Australian native species for almost 10 years. Through thorough species and habitat recovery programs, and rewilding, the conservation organisation has been building strong and healthy insurance populations of endangered native mammals and wishes to broaden its conservation work by acquiring the Curricabark property - a wildlife refuge protecting almost three dozen threatened native animals. You have helped us achieve so much! Now we are asking you to dig deep and help us protect and restore some of Australia?ôs remaining untouched forest.The problemThe wonderfully diverse continent, known for its unique fauna and flora, has been under many threats from wildlife annihilation for countless decades and the animal extinction crisis is a lifetime away from being remotely resolved. Indeed, Australia has the worst mammal extinction rate in the world and a high proportion of the country?ôs animals and plants are listed as threatened or endangered. At least 29 of Australia?ôs 273 mammal species have gone extinct since European settlement and an additional 21%, which is the equivalent of about 57 species, are predicted to go extinct at a rate of one to two species per decade without swift conservation action.As of today, nearly 1 out of 3 Australian unique mammals are at risk of becoming extinct. Whether it is from predation from feral pests, habitat degradation or other threats, our native animals are disappearing at an incredibly concerning rate. Sadly, most of those disappearing animal and plant species are endemic to Australia and found nowhere else on Earth.The solutionAussie Ark is taking action. You have helped us build strong insurance populations of threatened species. Now we are asked you to take a stand with us to protect remaining pockets of wilderness and habitat. We need to protect what is left. Curricabark is a 250hectare (618 acres and over 450 football fields!) property located near the Aussie Ark site high up in the Barrington Tops of NSW. This property has been registered as a wildlife refuge since 1974 and sits on 245 hectares of land. Curricabark Wildlife Refuge is home to over 30 threatened species and holds great importance for our wildlife. Because of its important biodiversity and untouched history, the property presents a rare and wonderful opportunity for our wildlife and must be protected into the future. Aussie Ark is asking for your help to secure this gem and thus allow us to protect and conserve the wildlife, as well as the rainforest and open Eucalypt forest communities, calling it home.In acquiring Curricabark Wildlife Refuge, Aussie Ark aims to expand its current area of influence, in addition to the list of species under its care. Some of the important and iconic species calling the refuge home include Koalas, Spotted tail quolls, greater gliders, regent honeyeater, Azure King fisher, Brush tail phascogale, glossy black cockatoo. How will the funds be spent?Aussie Ark needs only $120,000 to protect this parcel if wilderness. The funds will soley be utilised to purchase the property for protection. Aussie Ark will then be able to initiate much needed long-term management action to exclude invasive predators, aggressively manage weeds and protect the area from wildfire. Aussie Ark will rewild species once common to the area, and assist those already calling the area home to thrive. Who are we?Aussie Ark is NSW?ôs largest independently owned and operated conservation organisation and is home to seven keystone species once found in the Barrington Tops of NSW. Aussie Ark is an incorporated association and registered charity, with gift recipient status. Aussie Ark is located deep in the wet temperate forests of southeast Australia, and the globally significant bioregion of the Barrington? ops region of NSW, the region holds over 20% of all Australian vertebrate species. The location is dominated by mountain ash forest, and significant to both the flora and fauna that call it home. The area is topographically diverse and complex with altitudinal ranges from 200m rising to 1100m, with rugged remnant wet temperate forest, and ecological communities ranging from subalpine to sub tropical rainforests.Already Delivered Conservation SuccessesWorld class facilities for: Investment ($)Brush-tail Rock-Wallaby $150,000Manning River Turtles $110,000Tasmanian Devils $1,500,000Eastern Quolls $60,000Eco-Engineers $150,00031Km Predator Proof Fencing $4,500,000400Ha Barrington Sanctuary $1,200,000Aussie Ark has already returned Tasmanian Devils and Eastern Quolls to the Barrington Tops - this is just the START!?Aussie Ark is a conservation organisation, not a research facility, and is focussed on delivering long-term outcomes for Australia?ôs threatened species.

404,Sierra Streams Institute Jones Fire Recovery,"Created August 26, 2020",Environment,"$150,000 ","$35,974 ",237,599,237,"Along with many others in our community, we at Sierra Streams Institute (SSI), a local science-based nonprofit, are grieving in the wake of the Jones Fire. The Sierra Streams office and Environmental Center burned to the ground. Our hearts also go out to our neighbors who have also lost homes, businesses, and other structures.Recovery will be a long-term process, and your generous donation can help us through the difficult first steps. All of SSI?ôs material resources are gone, including: water quality monitoring equipment; computers; office furniture; printers; educational materials; libraries; biological and chemical equipment for analyzing water samples and macroinvertebrates; wildlife monitoring equipment; GPS units and cameras; physical habitat equipment; and samples, specimens and displays that cannot be replaced. Much of our equipment has depreciated significantly in value over time, and what we hope to receive from insurance will not go far enough towards the cost of purchasing replacement equipment.?Luckily, we are not our building, nor our equipment. SSI is a group of dedicated community members, and in this time of grief we are also celebrating our resilience. Like the trees in our surrounding forests that evolved with fire, we are defined not by our loss, but rather by our ability to recover from it. We are endlessly grateful for the firefighters who kept the fire from our town and population centers; for our generous and loving community; and for the passionate and skillful volunteers, staff and board of SSI. Together we have contributed over 24 years of service to Nevada County (and beyond), protecting the health of our watershed and community through restoration and education. With the support of our community we will move forward stronger than ever, committed to stewarding the environment that is our home, researching forest and fire interactions, keeping our water clean, and addressing other ongoing environmental issues that impact human and ecosystem health for years to come. We invite you to join us, and to support us in this time of renewal.Our current grant funding allows us to keep working on some ongoing projects, but it does not cover the new materials or the planning necessary for continuation. Immediate support will help pay staff through this period of recovery and planning, including inventory, needs assessment, research, equipment purchase, and the establishment of improved organizational systems and spaces. We hope to purchase new water quality and other equipment as soon as possible to allow us to continue to monitor our watershed in this post-fire period. Further, we hope to immediately get to work with the community and agencies impacted by the fire to learn what worked and what did not in terms of forest management and subsequent burn severity. This water quality and forest ecology work is time sensitive and depends on rebuilding our scientific inventory with your help.?To begin the recovery process and to sustain our organization through the coming months we have set a goal of $150,000 to address the major losses we have sustained. ?When we are further along in the insurance settlement process, and have an understanding of our remaining needs, we may be in need of additional support.?We are eager to return to work. With all of this change in our watershed, there is so much more to do -- more to monitor, more to learn, more to protect for the future. We are excited to learn more about our forests and provide support where we can as we watch them regrow, like us, from this fire. Perhaps they, and we, will be stronger for it in the long run. Thank you for supporting us and this place we call home.?To learn more about our organization and how we serve our community, please visit? our website at www.sierrastreamsinstitute.org.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of us were blessed to be given land that you couldn't possibly work on without more tools and a mule that won?ôt reproduce. This was also short-lived as the Department of Agriculture continued to move in racism and deny black and brown folx loans and assistance that white farmers easily received leading to a decline so devasting that we only make 2% of the population of farms.Our communities are filled with food desserts and inaccessibility to land ownership. In Pigford v. Glickman(1991), black farmers were finally awarded a monetary sum but it was only enough to maybe buy a tractor, definitely not enough for land. Once again the system left black people disenfranchised and with the need to figure it out without the access and capital that white people are granted without question.Now more than ever it is clear that we need our own spaces and ways to continue to help our community. The followings are the goals to be met with the gofundme.*I wanted to share a really amazing update.

When Black people were regarded as ?òproperty?? law would state property cannot own property.? This simple, dehumanising act has seeped its way into every facet of our current landscape; in everything from who owns land, who is able to access space, what activity is able to happen where, who gets policed, who gets displaced when neighbourhoods are developed, how people navigate the public realm and even who is expected to move out the way on pedestrian streets.?But over the years, Black people have found a number of ways of organising to collectively preserve, protect, amplify and celebrate their spaces. Look at the history of Community Land Trusts, pardnas, The Freedom Farm Cooperative and Ron Finley the Gangster Gardener. It is in this context that we find ourselves mobilising. It is time to invest in bold infrastructure and radical reclamations of our environment.

410,Linda J. Zhang Memorial Fund for the Environment,"Created July 21, 2020",Environment,"$10,000 ","$31,905 ",455,891,455,"The Linda J. Zhang Memorial Fund for the Environment is established to honor the life and passion of our sweet daughter Linda J. Zhang. Linda was a cheerful happy girl who always brought warmth and sunshine to her friends and family. She was a kind spirit, genuinely cared about her friends and always eager to lend a helping hand. She was a glue and organizer among her group of friends. She was full of kindness and empathy. She was full of life with her contagious laugh. She was passionate about many things, art, music and writing. Her interest in arts, music and writing began at an early age and started to blossom in high school. She was an avid reader, borrowed bags of books from our local library each week. She loved music and played piano since very young age and was an honor student in Hoff Barthelson music school. She was a gifted writer, a recipient of numerous honors and awards at the school, regional and national levels including a Scholastic gold medal in poetry in 2018 and a Claudia Ann Seaman Award for Fiction in 2019. She was an alumnus of several major national workshops for young writers including the highly selective and prestigious Iowa Young Writers Studio and the Kenyon Young Writers Workshop.In addition to her wide range of academic interests, she also developed a strong sense of community, social responsibility and public good beginning from her sophomore year at Greeley.? She worked at the Chappaqua Library as a student volunteer, and later as a paid page until graduation often assuming a leadership role for various programs from drawing classes to cooking activities. She dedicated many of her Saturdays as a volunteer piano teacher at a local charity music program for less privileged children. In 2019, she traveled to a remote rural area in China to teach English, art and music to elementary school kids there.Realizing the world was facing mounting problems: air pollution, plastic wastes accumulation, deforestation, extreme weather and global warming, she felt the urgency to act. She adopted a ?úzero waste??and plastics-free lifestyle. She advocated for the reduction of plastic usage whenever she could. She started a campaign at Horace Greeley, with the support of her friends, to replace bottled water with locally sourced water that contained no plastics in the school cafeteria. She participated in environment-related forums and created Youtube videos to help people to live sustainably. However, she was saddened, as she wrote in her open letter to the New York Times, ?údespite what we all know, the world still considers environmentalism to be something noble, something additional, rather than something necessary?? She felt lonely not having anyone understanding her for ?ùbeing the only one who sees the world for what it really is: a train wreck waiting to happen??if there were no drastic changes in how we live. Yet ?úit is all of us, slack-jawed at our screens, choosing what is easy over what is right.?ù¬?She no longer wanted to be ?úreciting poetry even as the world is burning?? ?On July 18, 2020 at 4:48 am, Linda ended her own life. Before her passing, she wrote an open letter and scheduled it to be emailed to the New York Times on the morning of July 19. When facing her lifeless body, our world crumbled into pieces. Why did this happen? We asked this question thousand times. When we went through her writings, we started to see things through her eyes and gain understanding of her passion.To us, she was always our little princess. We wanted her to have a good life, to have a good job and happy family. However, these nice things in life alone didn?ôt fulfill her. Atypical for an 18 year old, she gave a lot of thoughts about her life, the meaning of life itself and the fulfillment of life. She had strong sense of social responsibility and set a grand goal to do something good for humanity. A responsibility she took so wholeheartedly upon herself that she carried it with full determination.

412,Kuril Islands Research & Conservation Initiative,"Created April 20, 2020",Environment,"$80,000 ","$28,015 ",388,84,388,"The Kuril Islandshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHGarqZFY1kThe short film above documents a journey through the Kuril Islands off the coast of Far East Russia, and marine mammal biologist Vladimir Burkanov who is on a mission to protect them and the wildlife that lives there. In conjunction with the film, we are raising funds to support Vladimir?ôs work in this region, as the necessary financial resources for data collection in this region are very limited. Summary of fundraising goals(See more details in ?òFundraising goals??below)We?ôre looking to raise a total of 80,000 USD that will go towards four main fundraising goals.?1)? ~$25,000 for Sustainable Access: The Kurils can only be reached by sea, and ships are expensive. A research vessel has been made available, but we need to pay for maintenance, upkeep, and renovation to make this long-term solution a reality. This ship will allow scientists to access the Kuril Islands in a sustainable manner, and it will ensure that future funds go straight to science, rather than renting transportation which makes up 90% of total costs today.?2) ~$20,000 for Sustainable Research: The Tuleny Island Research Station is, in reality, an abandoned shell of a building in danger of collapse/irrecoverable damage. Vladimir and his students live in this structure each summer, and immediate funds are needed to make it liveable, including new fencing (keeps seals out of building and bird colonies), heating, wall and floor materials, and other basic infrastructure needed to keep this place alive. This will allow Vladimir and 15-20 research students the opportunity to focus on science and conservation.3) ~$20,000 for New Science: Scientific equipment allows Vladimir to operate efficiently over huge areas. A few weeks ago, Vladimir discovered that a storm surge over the winter had destroyed several custom-made timelapse cameras that he? uses to document marine mammal population changes (seen in the film!). These create the basic data needed to inform conservation plans, and they need to be replaced.?4) ~$15,000 for Long-Term Capacity Building: Vladimir?ôs long-term vision for the Kuril Islandsinvolves creating a long-lasting, self-sustaining marine monitoring program (KIRCI link?) with the staff needed to support it. These funds will be used to lay the foundation for this program, build a partnership with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,? and sustain long-term efforts in the Kurils long after the film has debuted.From Documentary to Impact ProjectOn July 8th 2019 a team of filmmakers (Taylor Rees and Renan Ozturk), photographers (Chris Burkard, Jeff Kerby, and Ted Hesser), and scientists (Rishi Sugla, Jeff Kerby) and expedition leader (Povel Torudd) set sail into the North Pacific to document this sparsely known part of the world. The goal was to share it's natural beauty with the world in a short adventure documentary film, presented by the online storytelling channel Tomorrow Unlocked.?As we began our journey in Petropovalask, we picked up an unexpected guest: Vladimir Burkanov, a Russian marine scientist who has studied marine mammals in the region for over 30 years. Vladimir asked to hitch a ride on our boat to check in on his timelapse cameras and pick up scientific equipment he left on the islands that are used to monitor the health of Stellar sea lions and Northern Fur Seals across the islands.??What we couldn't have guessed is that over the next couple of weeks Vladimir would become an inspiration to us all. Even with limited research funding for marine scientists in the region, Vladimir has managed to keep up a collection of the longest scientific dataset of marine life in the region- all through humour and passion for this region he hopes will be protected one day.?Vladimir? taught us about the ecosystem of the Kuril Islands, its climate, and its role as one of the last wild places in the entire Pacific Rim. He took us to tiny spots that only someone who calls a place home could ever know about. He showed us the magic of the Kurils and everything it has to offer the world. He shared stories with us of his time there, spanning the thirty years he?ôs spent exploring the vast remoteness of the islands.Known unknownsThis place, like many beautiful and biodiverse places, is threatened. Vladimir's records of marine mammals show drastic changes are already happening to Northern fur seal and Steller sea lion populations in the area, but there isn?ôt enough environmental monitoring data to understand why.We know that greater fishing pressures, land uses changes, and the impacts of climate change in the region will all leave their fingerprints on this incredible place, but the international community of scientists and conservationists has yet to understand how. Increasing tourism is also a new threat and there is an urgent need to know what?ôs happening to this ecosystem and what is needed to protect it. Collecting robust environmental data is crucially important. It helps inform sound policy and scientific projections of the future that can guide the region towards a conservation plan that will keep these ecosystems healthy for generations?Creating a self-sustaining research program in the region takes time, resources, and scientific equipment that, frankly, costs money. We are here to help make an impact by supporting these initiatives. Fundraising : Our goalsThe first step in collecting the data needed to inform long-term conservation plans is making sure scientists like Vladimir have their own means of transport along the island chain. For years now, Vladimir has taken to hitch-hiking across the archipelago like he did with us to: collect his data; meet up with his students (stationed at a remote field site on Tuleny Island); and keep up his long-term observations of the Kuril Islands - one of the only long-term records of marine life that exists in the entire region.While Vladimir?ôs dedication is inspiring, it isn?ôt sustainable in the long run. To start off a long-term program in the region and support Vladimir, we're starting off with an ambitious goal to raise $80,000.?Our major fundraising goal will address the four main challenges Vladimir and his fellow researchers face in the Kurils: 1. Sustainable Access, 2. Sustainable Research, 3. Investing in New Science, 4. Building Capacity to Turn Science into Action.?Sustainable access is critical to research in the Kuril Islands. Over 90% of all research costs go towards transportations on the ships that Vladimir uses to refuel and resupply the Tuleny Island research station and get back to his timelapse cameras. After our film and with the anticipation of your upcoming support, Vladimir decided to purchase a 65??research . The hope is this vessel might be a place not just for Vladimir and his students, but for international collaborations. These vessels are cheap to operate compared to other research vessels and, as a bonus, emit less CO2 than fossil-fueled powered vessels. While a large investment of money, having a sailboat will help Vladimir open up the entire region to scientists all over the world who want to access the region for many years to come. Currently, the ship needs repairs (there is no freshwater system on the boat!). We are hoping to raise $25,000 for Vladimir to fix the water system and pay for boat maintenance for his first year with the boat.?Our second major goal is to renovate the Tuleny Island Research Station that houses Vladimir and his students. Over the past few years, the research station hasn't had funds for upkeep and maintenance. Right now, the team makes do without heating, running water, or a functional kitchen. But the good news is that the foundation of the building is still in great shape, and with repair to the kitchen facilities and heating system, the building could easily house international researchers.? This research station was once a site used? to process furs from the seals in the region. Vladimir and his colleagues have already transformed it into a place to understand the region, rather than extract from it. We are asking for $20,000 to help Vladimir transform it further into a place for management, conservation, and international scientific collaboration in the Kurils. When completely operational, the Tuleny Island Research station has? rooms to house anywhere from 15-20 scientists at a time when everything is functioning correctly.?The Kurils Islands are remote, rugged, and sometimes rough. It has rapidly shifting weather, intense winters, and marine life that, while cute, isn't always gentle. As you've seen in the film, Vladimir uses timelapse cameras to keep tabs on the population of Northern Fur Seals and Steller Sea Lions from afar. This allows him to efficiently make his way through the entire island chain while collecting data. Recently, a large storm event knocked out a few of his cameras. We're going to help replace them by raising $20,000.?Our final goal is to make sure the release of the film is the start of something, not the end. Vladimir has helped us imagine the Kuril Islands as the site of international collaborations between Russian and non-Russian scientists. We are committed to creating a long-lasting and self-sustaining marine monitoring program in the Kuril Islands. Expedition member Rishi Sugla, at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, is working with Vladimir to make this a reality. We hope (when safe) to host in-person fundraising events to raise start-up funds for the research program and non-profit. ~$15,000 from this fundraiser will be used to host the first event at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, one of the world?ôs leading oceanographic institutions. Vladimir?ôs hope is to use the data collected to create a marine park system in the Kuril Islands in collaboration with the Russian government and international scientists at places such as Scripps.?Saving the Kuril Islands starts nowSo often, we wait until it's too late to move forward and fight for wild places and the people who live there. In the case of the Kurils, time hasn't run out yet. This is a part of the world that hasn't lost it's past- a beautiful piece of our planet that is worth holding onto.?Please help us take the next step on the journey to protect the Kurils that Vladimir helped start long ago.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each passing moment, her curiosity, eagerness to learn and experience everything around started shaping her loving, kind, and cheerful personality. She had this profound maturity and very caring to all around her, especially her older siblings. Rarely a frown or sadness, almost as if she knew life was too precious and too short for these feelings.About three summers ago, we started a vegetable garden in our backyard. Bianca was the first to help her Dad in the preparations, including using a big shovel to flip the soil. So little and yet so strong. Many Sunday mornings, she would go to the back and bring green onions for the traditional scrambled eggs. Our garden called many bees to our yard, and with that, a growing sense of happiness to see them.Bianca suddenly and unexpectedly left us on September 27, 2020 after 4 days in the hospital from a bleed in the brain caused by AVMs. She had many nicknames: Bianquinha, Ping-Pong, Pupula, Beb√™, but when we would write about her on messages, she was just simply ?úB??She lived a full, loving, and joyful 7 years.

We,? the members of Millbourne Resident's Association, have been fighting to save a small parcel of green space, which we should? be entitled to, for 6+ years, and after the latest planning injustice, we have had ENOUGH! Recently, An Bord Plean√°la (ABP) granted permission to a developer to build on the only greenspace in our estate of more than 300 homes. This on the back of several planning applications submitted to Meath County Council and each time, the residents rallied together as a community and fought the application. An Bord Plean√°la has twice refused permission to build on the green space, stating that it is the ONLY open green space for the children in the Millbourne estate, an essential amenity for mental health and well-being. Despite the resilience of the residents, and despite the acknowledgement that this is the only greenspace available in what is otherwise a concrete jungle, permission has been granted to the developer to build 30 apartments on our only green space. This small parcel of land represents the only remaining green space in our estate. It falls far short of the 15% that Meath County Council considers to be the bare minimum for a housing estate but it is all we have and all that we will ever have. Despite the council?ôs commitment to propose that the site be rezoned as public greenspace ABP own inspector?ôs strongly worded report, ABP have decided to overturn their previous decisions to deny permission to build on our green. Scandalously, they point to the school yards and GAA pitches as all the greenspace our children deserve ??we need not tell you that both are private property. ABP?ôs own inspector pointed to the undesirable precedent that would be set if permission was granted to build on our children?ôs green. Simply put, if they do this to us, there is nothing stopping them doing it to other communities and families! For decency, for justice, for the environment, for our children and your own, please lend us your support.? We must stand together as a community, as a society. The stakes are high and extend far beyond one estate!!!! The residents of Millbourne have fought these decisions every step of the way, but now, the only road ahead of us is a costly, legal one.

Unfortunately our efforts have been unproductive with continued stated policy from DFO that change is not possible until required Fisheries Act can be adapted.The frustration of the above resulted in a demonstration test fishery despite threats from DFO that participants could be charged with fishing illegally.

Zambezi Horse Safaris has assisted in anti-poaching operations in the Victoria Falls region for many years.

The owner-manager Alison Baker is a passionate conservationist and supporter of animal welfare, who goes out of her way to rescue any animal that needs help. Alison and her team of Scouts and horses play a massive role in wildlife conservation, and have been doing so, very quietly, for years. They are an integral part of anti-poaching work around Victoria Falls, doing daily patrols in areas that other units cannot reach by road or on foot.

Unfortunately this funding is still uncertain. Any donations we can raise at this point will help demonstrate the importance of the project and thus help ensure that the County secures the necessary funding. If that happens, we will be able to use the donated funds for other improvements to the trail, in consultation with our donors.Help us raise money to repair the sinkhole that has closed the Zip Line! The Zip Line is the popular segment of Milwaukee's Oak Leaf Trail that connects Estabrook Park in Shorewood with Brown Deer Park and the Ozaukee Interurban Trail. The Zip Line is one of the most heavily trafficked sections of the Oak Leaf Trail and is relied on by hundreds of commuters and recreational users every day.In the Spring of 2020, a sinkhole that had been expanding slowly for years grew so large that the trail had to be closed. The sinkhole is atop a century-old culvert with a creek flowing through it, and both the culvert and the trail now need to be reconstructed, all without blocking the flow of the creek. ?Milwaukee County Parks has determined that fixing the hole will cost about $600,000- a huge undertaking for our already cash-strapped parks system.Milwaukee County Parks has received a grant from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation to cover the cost of the repair, but the grant requires Milwaukee County Parks to cover 20% of the cost ($120,000). ?Your contributions can help cover this cost! The County is working to find the funds for the match in its budget, but any amount we can raise will help demonstrate the importance of the project and will help support our trails by freeing up funds for other purposes.Milwaukee County Parks has lined up an anonymous donor who is willing to MATCH community donations, up to $5,000.

Great question.?Here are 10 ways urban farms are contributing to the improved health of their communities:1. REDUCE CARBON?EMISSIONSBy localizing produce, urban farms cut down on the significant amount of fossil fuel consumption necessary to transport, package, and sell food. The average meal has traveled 4,200 miles just to get to your table. Urban agriculture helps consumers reduce their ?úfoodprint??by providing them the opportunity to purchase food that was grown within their community.2. INNOVATIVE?TECHNIQUESAs city spaces lack the wide-open fertile grounds of traditional farming methods, urban farmers are tasked with finding creative solutions to dealing with challenges like waste, space, resources, and energy. Because of this, more efficient innovations are created to improve the quality and quantity of food that can be produced with the least amount of resources. (For example, the vertical aquaponic systems of The Growing Experience in Long Beach produce 3-4 times as much produce as traditional farming methods and use significantly less water.)3. JOB?CREATIONFrom window box herb gardens to large community spaces, these farms create opportunities to involve the community. Urban farms create job (and volunteer) opportunities in big cities, where poverty and hunger are often persistent issues. An increase in small businesses stimulates local economy and supports the community by creating jobs right where people live.4. ECONOMIC?GROWTHBy virtue of their proximity to consumers, urban farms stimulate local economy by circulating income throughout the region. Without a complicated distribution network, farmers are more connected to their market and able to adapt quickly to demand, maximizing profit. In addition, many of these organizations are structured in a way that brings additional benefit to the community and support to low income populations by stabilizing food costs and in many cases, offering discounted or free produce.5. COMMUNITY?BUILDINGGardens create more than healthy, delicious food. Urban agriculture brings people together with a common interest ?î¬†food. The overall health of a community is benefited by increasing its capacity to create an environment that truly sustains its residents. Most urban farming projects require a high level of social organization, giving many individuals in the community a vested interest in its success.""Cool to Live""- Dj Cavem ft. Cody ChesnuTT6. PUBLIC?HEALTHIncreasing populations of people in cities suffer from malnutrition and a variety of other diet-related health issues. Bringing nutritious food to local communities has many direct health benefits, including reducing the risk of harmful conditions like heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and more. Involving individuals in the garden itself provides an opportunity for exercise and a deeper connection to agriculture.7. FOOD?QUALITYSmaller scale, local markets provide the opportunity for farmers to foster more unique varieties of produce. These farms preserve biodiversity by cultivating heirloom varieties or those with lower shelf-stability. The proximity and connectedness to market allows for fresh, nutritious produce to become available to communities that have never had access to this in the past.8. FOOD?SECURITYWhile there may not be a ?úshortage??of food in most regions, issues of access are absolutely prevalent ?î¬†especially in urban areas. In Orange County, about 400,000 people do not have access to affordable, healthy food. Urban agriculture helps to correct this by reducing the price of healthy food by eliminating the middleman and increasing the opportunity for community members in need to participate in the growing of this food. Many urban farms also adopt charitable models in an effort to support communities in need through direct donation or by providing either discounted or free produce.9.?EDUCATIONUrban agriculture addresses another issue inherent throughout our current food culture ?î¬†a disconnection to where our food comes from. By involving children and adults alike in education around sustainable, local agriculture, farmers increase the health of our future food systems.10. GREEN?SPACELastly, agriculture in cities provides something obvious ?î¬†more green space. This contributes to the health of city ecosystems in a variety of ways. Greenery adds aesthetic appeal, reduces runoff from precipitation, provides restful spaces for the community, and counters the heat island effect by fixing carbon through photosynthesis.Source?What does the O.G.?Ron Finley have to say about our work?""We are all in a fight for our culture, our food, and our lives.

This means that Canadians and Nova Scotians lose beach access. It also means that the protection of the critically endangered piping plovers living and breeding on the beach has not been considered.

Don?ôt you?Despite the long, contentious history of the hog factory, without prior public input, Stone Mills Council chose to side with the interests of one individual rather than the well-being of the greater community, and they approved the development of an intensive hog factory in Erinsville.The location of this industrial livestock operation was a bad idea in 2001 and it is still a bad idea today. The community of Erinsville in Eastern Ontario is threatened by the development of its first industrial hog operation: on fractured limestone, in a tourist region, among rural residences and cottages, behind the hamlet of Erinsville, close to Beaver Lake and White Lake in the Salmon River Watershed. We are driven by Stone Mills Council?ôs failure to invite public input prior to approving this project, the absence of any benefit whatsoever to the community and most importantly, the clear threat to residents??health and safety. Help support our goal of raising $50,000 by September 15, 2020!In response, Concerned Citizens for our Community Environments Inc. hired experts who have exposed the risks to groundwater and surface water and thus the clear risk to public health and safety.

438,COVID-19 Indigenous Seed Crisis Response Circle,"Created August 18, 2020",Environment,"$35,000 ","$14,206 ",208,693,208,"Since the creation stories of this continent to the genocidal colonial policies and practices that persist today, Indigenous-to-North-America communities have been singing to, praying for, dancing with, and co-cultivating the seeds they belong to as an act of relational governance and intergenerational love. This good work ??in defiance of industrial agriculture, seed commodification, and biocolonialism ??is heart?ôs work, and is chronically targeted and under-resourced within dominating systems of racial injustice and displacement denying accountability to Indigenous peoples and the food agreements that are their sacred inheritance.?COVID-19 has exacerbated the pre-existing food insecurities and injustices in Indigenous communities that are resultant of these systems. Indigenous seed keepers and earth workers have been experiencing an increase in Indigenous seed need and an increase in interest across their communities in gardening, seed keeping, and ancestrally-informed food processing and preservation practices. This swelling passion for food sovereignty is exciting, but it has also meant that the demand for seed is higher than Indigenous seed keepers??seed supply, putting communities' already precarious seed stocks at risk. Many Indigenous seed keepers have been faced with the decision to gift seed for food at the risk of losing an ancestral variety. Throughout these precarious times, many COVID-19 funding solutions have been implemented without Indigenous communities??collaboration and consent, leading to ineffective response efforts and deepened harms.?Communities impacted by such factors as racism, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, colonialism, and ableism know best the solutions and pathways for healthier, just realities for their people. This is certainly the case Indigenous people in so-called?Canada, who have long been calling for?justice, unobstructed pursuits of inherent sovereignty, and land back, and who have been innovatively caring for their seed relations against all odds.?In response to the preexisting food insecurities intensified by COVID-19, Sovereign Seeds?is??facilitating the COVID-19 Indigenous Seed Crisis Response Circle?,?an Indigenous seed stewardship collective operating with a commitment to nurture Indigenous seed varieties for improved seed health and access through and beyond this pandemic. Through this?collaboratively-governed seed network, dedicated Indigenous seed leaders have come together to grow Indigenous seed varieties in the 2020 growing season to increase Indigenous seed supply. Seeds generated through the Circle will be lovingly redistributed to Indigenous individuals and initiatives requiring access to their ancestral seeds for food and seed saving next year.?Indigenous seed keepers and initiatives comprising this collaborative seed collective span across what is colonially known as Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick, and include Blackbird Medicines?,?Igataqan, Ininƒ´wikistayik?win, Kenhte:ke Seed Sanctuary and Learning Centre (KSSLC),?Kete Miinakaan Kitigaanens,?Mtigwaaking, and Stephen Silverbear McComber of Kahnawake Collective Impact?ôs?Three Sisters Mound Garden initiative. This project is inspired by a project recently initiated by Sovereign Seeds??partner network, the Indigenous Seed Keepers Network? (ISKN), who are developing an Indigenous-led Indigenous Seed Growers Cooperative?south of the border.?While Indigenous people continue to navigate the deliberately disproportionate impacts of colonialism, environmental racism, climate change, and occupation, seeds are, as they have always been, a living and sacred relationship of celebratory resilience and joy. Through this project, Circle members are not only strengthening communities??and seeds??preparedness for pandemics and climate change, they are also keeping alive ancestral seed economies of community reciprocity and care, asserting Indigenous sovereignty, and (re)claiming the ancestral food relationships they belong to.Your donation?to the Circle will go directly towards supporting these seed leaders and the people and communities who will receive?the seeds they are cultivating.

Anything extra helps Shark Allies to continue working on important campaigns like these.?During the campaign, we met some incredible conservationists, one of them being Kelly Quinn (@kellyofthewild). Through her art and education, Kelly inspires the protection of wildlife and their delicate ecosystems. Kelly's mural will colorfully showcase Kristin's legacy, as well as her relentless devotion to the conservation of Florida's waters, and the importance of healthy shark populations. ?Kristin was an environmental warrior to say the least, testifying in front of the United States Congress for the Clean Water Act and climate change, and serving on the National Climate Preparedness and Resilience Task Force, with great recognition by President Obama. Grateful doesn't even begin to describe how we feel to have had the opportunity to work with such a resilient, passionate and badass woman. Whenever somebody told Kristin that it was impossible, boy did she prove them all wrong, handling everything with power and grace. We will never stop looking up to her.

Response to COVID-19 has dramatically reduced funding and the project is in jeopardy of closing forever!??Coral reefs are ?úrainforests of the sea??and are the most diverse ecosystems on our planet.? Coral reefs support 25 percent of ALL marine life. Coral reefs also protect coastlines from storms and erosion, they provide jobs and recreation, and are a source of food and nutrition. ?Most of us will never see a coral reef, let alone swim around one, but you need them just like they need you to survive.Unfortunately, coral reefs around the world are threatened by many factors that may include climate change, but due to unsustainable fishing practices, coastal? development, and pollution we have lost 30 to 50 percent of tropical coral reefs since the 1980s. Dr. Timothy Bromage and his researchers at New York University?ôs Coral Development (NYUCD) laboratory created a comprehensive system for identifying causes of coral reef decline, combining tests for 71 element contaminants with tests for bacteria, water quality, and microplastics.? With support of the United Nations, NYUCD researchers tested this system in the island state of Samoa and discovered real causes of poor coral reef health rooted in agricultural activities, which the government is now tackling.? Unfortunately,? additional funds for investigation of the dozens of other threatened coral reef systems around the world are not forthcoming.Most nation states in the world have stopped funding environmental programs due to the global pandemic, and efforts to take the NYUCD system to other coral reef sites have stopped.? We can fix this.? Our lofty goal is $2,500,000, which will tackle the small low and middle income nation and island states in the world with coral reefs.? ?With your help we can continue this work through your tax-deductible donation today, one country at a time.??How the Funds Will Be UsedThe NYUCD laboratory is the ONLY?facility in the world specifically configured with the unique collection of high technology instruments necessary for carrying out this research. All funds will be deposited into an NYUCD Fund research account of New York University's office of financial operations. Two thirds of the expense of this research is for operational costs of the technology used for evaluating water chemistry, bacteria, and microplastics. The remaining third of the expense is for travel, consumables, and the field expenses of collecting seawater and freshwater samples. Not only is the seawater tested, but all major rivers and streams are tested too, as these are typically the sources of contaminants. There are 80 countries in the world with coral reefs. With the target funding and logistical assistance from our UN partners, we can test approximately half of the nation states for $330/square km of coral reef, which represent the world's most vulnerable sites, over 5-10 years.

Bio:Following an undergraduate degree at the California State University at Sonoma in Anthropology, Biology, and Geology, Timothy G. Bromage obtained his MA and then in 1986 his PhD in Biological Anthropology from the University of Toronto with Prof. Becky Sigmon. The later years of his PhD program were completed in the Department of Anatomy and Embryology, University College London with Prof. Alan Boyde. Tim was awarded a NATO Postdoctoral Fellowship in 1987 and in 1988 appointed as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Child Dental Health, London Hospital Medical College, University of London with Prof. Jim Elliott. In 1989 he took a position in the Department of Anthropology, Hunter College, City University of New York, where he remained for 15 years. There he developed the first fully digital light and electron microscopy facility in the United States, and together with his preparation laboratory, created the Hard Tissue Research Unit (HTRU; stony corals are hard!). In 2004 Tim moved the HTRU to the NYU College of Dentistry and further introduced an isotope laboratory within the laboratory.Primary foci of research in the HTRU emphasize organismal development and life history, as well as for what ?úsignals??exist in hard tissues of variability in the external environment. His research has been reported in >200 papers and cited more than 5,600 times. He holds two patents from NYU, for a portable confocal microscope and for a method for simultaneously determining the absolute concentrations of 71 elements in seconds from aqueous solutions. His funding has largely come from the NIH, NSF, the Max Planck Society and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and the United Nations Development Program.

He worked honestly for decades in order to create an accessible path to his personal Old Growth Redwood Canyon to share with other people (strangers and friends around the world) for years in order to promote and teach about sustainable living and environmentalism. Despite years of work on wildfire clearance and other precautions, on August 18, 2020, this beautiful slice of the world that has been a sanctuary for wildlife and his home was thoroughly burnt by a wildfire that was started by an arsonist.

Any help will go towards helping him start over after this total immeasurable loss and to provide resources that will develop and restore this amazing wild California Redwood Canyon and make it a place that can be appreciated and explored by people in order to continue to promote conservation and environmental responsibility.The aftermath has been so devastating. ALL of the necessary equipment to restore basic water systems and manage the ongoing spot fires was itself completely incinerated. The fire started at 8:00pm August 18 and it was visible at the peak of the canyon at 9:30pm. I was called to help evacuate the most wonderful dog, Zoie, and when I arrived at 10:30pm the fire was along the entire canyon ridge, a several mile long wall of fire that was quickly moving down into the canyon. Due to recent hot weather, the fire spread rapidly and was intensely hot, sending scattered 40 foot columns of fire into the sky as the dry trees on the ridge caught fire. There was absolutely no fighting chance. There was only two hours from when the fire was visible at the top of the canyon until this man had to evacuate. He just watched everything he owned and worked for burn from the highway. The next day he returned to the canyon in order to manage ongoing spot fires, clear the road, and to control gas fires that burned inside of the base of the giant Redwood trees and thus preventing the giants from falling, when possible.It's so hard for me to convey with just words how remarkable, hard working, and wonderful this man is and so I especially want to thank everyone who knows him and has shared their personal stories about him and the soulful experience of visiting this canyon.?I will try to post more updates about the situation, but I will also include as many pictures from before the Dolan fire to show the immense beauty that was lost. Thousands of thank yous to? everyone who has reached out and helped support Richard.Even if you can't donate, please help by sharing this story:https://gf.me/u/ysikkqRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial numbers indicate that over 50% of people under the age of 45 have lost their job or have had their hours reduced, and still leaders from across the country are now putting MORE time into Sunrise work specifically because they have more time on their hands due to loss of work.?These Sunrise members need your support.The funds raised on this page are intended to support movement members who have had cut or reduced hours due to COVID-19. We will be prioritizing leaders that are giving a minimum of 5-10+ hours a week to Sunrise work, acknowledging that volunteers??capacities vary week-to-week, especially during this crisis. Additionally, we know that systemic financial barriers have existed and will continue to exist for marginalized groups. We have sought to establish a fair assessment system to assist those with the greatest need.The national Sunrise organization can not legally give lump sum payments to individuals in a way that this GoFundMe can. We need you to help embody our Movement Principles, which state that ?úwe ask for help and we give what we can??(principle 6) and that ?úwe take care of ourselves, each other, and our shared home??(principle 9).

We are asking for donations to hire an Attorney by July 30th to STOP the permit renewal for an Asphalt Plant right next to our neighborhood. The Asphalt Plant has been polluting the air in our extended area for years!In May of 2018, the?pollutants were so bad, our neighborhood Elementary had to be?evacuated because?the school building was filled with the noxious fumes from the Asphalt plant, but taking everyone outside didn't even help! When the Plant is operating, there is no escaping the fumes! The fumes are even worse outside. While evacuated, the kids were covering their faces and crying because the fumes were burning their eyes, nose and throat so bad!!After the evacuation, the Asphalt Plant had to cease operations due to a multitude of violations from TCEQ and the carcinogens they were releasing into our air. Because of this, we've had clean air for over 2 years!!? It's been wonderful and we need to Keep it Clean!!TCEQ has not held up its role as a ""Commission on Environmental Quality."" In fact, TCEQ has been a willing and active contributor in allowing the Asphalt Plant to pollute our air and lungs for YEARS.? TCEQ has repeatedly granted the renewal of this plant's air permit, DESPITE hundreds of pleas by nearby neighbors over the last 15+ years, countless violations from TCEQ themselves and enforcement actions, and their own admissions that ""human health or the environment has been exposed to significant amounts of pollutants."" Despite all of this, they are still gearing up to allow the permit to be renewed yet again.? Due to the facts that: 1) TCEQ has attorneys handling this matter for them, 2) the Asphalt Plant has attorneys handling this matter for them, 3) our community has handled this matter to date through grass roots/individual efforts ONLY, we feel strongly that WE MUST HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO HELP US form a coalition and get us across the finish line this time, as our efforts to date have not yielded the results needed to ensure the Asphalt Plant does not resume operations near our homes.? If we do not stop the permit renewal at this time, it will be renewed for another TEN YEARS - and we will not be able to get it taken away once it is granted.TCEQ is about to renew the Asphalt Plant's permit to begin operating at this location and thus ALLOW THEM TO REPEAT THE PAST AND POLLUTE the air once?again with an abundance of carcinogens into the neighborhoods, day cares, businesses and several schools nearby!?We CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN!!!! PLEASE HELP US! Consider what you would do to make sure your family and friends had clean air.The SOLE PURPOSE of all collected funds will be to do the following: engage counsel, have them review our summary materials to bring them up to speed, have them attend the August 6 Public Meeting regarding the Air Permit Renewal, and have them engage with TCEQ, the City of Frisco, and the Asphalt Plant to help arrange for a solution that provides us with something IN WRITING stating that the Asphalt Plant will NEVER AGAIN resume operations at this location AND NO OTHER SUBSEQUENT BUSINESS, ENTITY OR LAND OWNER will do same.? Any money not used for this sole purpose will be refunded, per whatever protocols GoFundMe has in place.Thank you for your support. Please SHARE our page.

At a time of climate emergency and growing social divide across the world, Distant Relatives aims to bring a message of optimism and inspiration, as well as to stimulate the local economy through all of our operations and activities.Our philosophy has always been to work around nature, rather than making nature work around us: all of our accommodations are made by local people with local materials and intertwine with the surrounding environment, connect us with the natural world and minimize our footprint wherever possible.Distant Relatives is made of 30+ wonderful staff, most of whom are from the immediate local area with near to no current income and very little resources/savings. There?ôs nothing the entire team would love more than to ensure we can continue to welcome all of you beautiful people for the decades to come.Today, Distant Relatives is #CallingAllRelatives as we are in trouble and we could really use your help. We?ôll make sure to give back to you and to the community ten-fold, in part with rewards listed below and in part in hugs, thanks, love and big vibes from the entire Distant Relatives team.?We hope to welcome you back to your second home in Kenya soon!Love from your Distant Relatives.Who is Distant Relatives:Sitting above the emerald waters of Kilifi Lagoon is Distant Relatives Ecolodge & Backpackers: a community hub, an eccentric ecolodge, a backpacking haven, an experimental model of conscious living, located in Kilifi - coastal Kenya?ôs hidden gem.?The name ?úDistant Relatives??encapsulates the central principle of the project: ?úWe?ôre all Distant Relatives?? From the beginning in 2012, Distant Relatives immediately became a community hub for Kilifi connecting distant travellers with our lovely local community. The aim was to bring together humans from the surrounding areas as well as from all around the world to learn, share, exchange and inspire one another; to make them all feel immediately and wholeheartedly welcome, as well as to build lasting relationships based on an understanding and appreciation of community and sustainability.?Our dream was for Distant Relatives to also become an inspiring experimental model for more sustainable and more conscious living. At a time of climate emergency and growing social divide across the world, Distant Relatives aims to bring a message of optimism and inspiration. From Permaculture gardens to easily replicable (and many times replicated!) custom dry compost toilet systems, planting and giving away hundreds of indigenous trees, bi-annual Permaculture Design Courses, natural grey water treatment systems, optimized water harvesting, the continuous upcycling of hundreds of tyres, thousands of bottles and countless other small and large experimental projects exploring how to minimize our footprint as humans, Distant Relatives wants to continue participating in creating a more sustainable Kilifi for future travellers and locals alike.Just a 60km drive away from the bustling streets of Mombasa and the tourist center of Malindi, Kilifi offers a refreshing taste of pristine, untouched coastline. Start your mornings with the smell of freshly brewed Kenyan Coffee, sunrise yoga and a dip in the pool. Fill your days sunbathing on Bofa Beach, reef snorkelling in crystal clear waters, exploring nearby historical Gede Ruins or playing Beach Volleyball at sunset. Dream without falling asleep--at night enjoy a moonlit dhow sail, beach bonfires, live music and a starry bioluminescent sea.?As a traveler's haven, Distant Relatives offers a pocket-friendly alternative to other coastal accommodations - from camping under the stars, airy dormitories, safari tents, private rooms and spacious en suite Bandas with their own private gardens and courtyards. Our philosophy has always been to work around nature, rather than making nature work around us: all of our accommodations are made by local people with local materials and intertwine with the surrounding environment, connect us with the natural world and minimize our footprint wherever possible.Our financial situation:Our running costs have been minimized to the absolute maximum and despite that, we are already into debt simply trying to keep our property secure, do damage control through the stormy rainy season, and cover our on-going administration and operational costs.?Despite our efforts to minimize costs to the absolute bare minimum and some provider?ôs generosity to give us time for unpaid bills and even waived bills, Distant Relatives still requires security staff and a minimum of gardening, maintenance and admin presence, as well as many other expenses resulting in expenses upwards of 520,000 Ksh (4,500 Eur) per month. Having already spent every bit of savings we had and having accumulated a debt of approximately 1,630,000 Ksh (about 14,200 Eur) and aware that we will need a minimal capital to restart operations, we are seeking to raise 3,000,000 Ksh (30,000 Eur) to be able to get us out of this dark tunnel and back onto the shiny road:- Food relief packages to all staff and their families.- Small monetary contributions to all staff sent on unpaid leave.- Wages for the few remaining skeleton staff- NSSF: Social Security for employees.?- NHIF: Health insurance for employees.- Water bill (because some staff live on site, to maintain gardens and swimming pool).- Power bills since February.- Security company bills.- Food for our animals (Mowgly, chickens & ducks).- Business Licenses, our co-Founder?ôs Work Permit, some unpaid salaries, Online Travel Agent bills and software licenses.- Maintenance (collapsed roof; new door, window bars and fence to fix to reinforce security since a recent semi-violent robbery incident by desperate thieves)- Unpaid bills (accounting, pending supplier invoices since the close of our business)Our goal is also to ensure we can continue our operations once again, as our business model is designed to work with hundreds of partners throughout the local community to ensure that our business is stimulating the local economy in numerous ways, both directly and indirectly. There is nothing more we wish for, than to continue operating, educating, inspiring and learning from and alongside our local and global community for years to come!?What we would like to offer you:In exchange for your contribution, we would like to give back to you both as much as we can and as soon as we can!

452,Help Save Hawaiian Birds:  ªA ªole Mosquitoes,"Created July 30, 2020",Environment,"$10,000 ","$11,800 ",220,1.8K,220,"Shirt link: https://www.bonfire.com/help-save-hawaiian-birds-aole-mosquitoes/?Hawai ªi is?the extinction capitol of the world and that includes many of our amazing native birds. Over 77 species of birds have gone extinct since the arrival of people in the islands and over 30 of those were lost because of the introduction of mosquitoes. That's right, before 1826 Hawai ªi had no mosquitoes! Since their introduction mosquitoes have spread deadly avian malaria and avian pox to some of our most incredible and iconic native birds and are continuing to threaten our few surviving species.Image of a mosquito biting an  ªApapane by Jack JeffreyOn Maui and Kaua ªi in particular, warming temperatures are allowing mosquitoes to expand their range into the last high elevation areas where native birds have so far been able to escape extinction. In the last 10 years some birds have declined by 50, 75, and even 98% almost entirely thanks to mosquitoes. If nothing is done, by 2100,? experts believe a majority of the remaining native Hawaiian birds will most likely be extinct in the wild or highly endangered.Original art work by H. Douglas Pratt. Diversity of Hawaiian honeycreepers and extinction. Birds with red Xs are extinct, red circles are critically endangered, and yellow circles are threatened or endangered. All of the extinctions pictured here were driven primarily by mosquitoes.?Fortunately, there are are some newly emerging technologies that are producing promising results in the fight against mosquitoes. For the first time in almost 200 years there are some possible solutions for safely removing mosquitoes and finally being able to protect native birds of Hawai ªi from the devastating plagues that they spread. One method that has been widely used around the world is wholbachia. Its a type of stomach bacteria that lives in the gut of most of the insects around the world. Interestingly though, if a male and a female mosquito have different strains of this bacteria they can ªt produce any young! This method has helped reduce wild mosquitoes by as much as 96% in some studies! The other method that provides a more permanent solution uses a form of genetic engineering called CRISPR to modify male (they don ªt bite! only female mosquitoes will bite birds or humans) mosquitoes so that they can only produce male offspring. As this gene spreads eventually all of the mosquitoes will be male and they will die out. This technology offers the first best hope to save Hawai ªi's birds. Check out this link for more info: https://abcbirds.org/biotechnology-hawaiis-invasive-mosquitoes/?In order to help our native birds the University of Hawai ªi at Hilo Mosquito Research Lab is working hard to develop both the Wolbachia and CRISPR technologies for use in the field, but they are in need of assistance to fund their critically important work and help move their projects forward. The biggest threat to the native birds in Hawai ªi is certainly mosquitoes, but the second is time. The time it takes to develop, test, and implement these new technologies can make all the difference for the birds. Unprecedented technology provides? hope to save our birds, but there is also fear that the help may come too late to stop extinction. Extinction is forever. Please contribute whatever you can to help support this critical research and help speed up the development of these technologies to save native Hawaiian bird species.

Sadly, due to the ongoing economic impact of COVID-19, a large portion of our funding which enabled us to employ our VFAPU scouts, which provided them with livelihoods, whilst also providing us with the logistical means to carry out our anti-poaching patrols, has unfortunately had to be cut back and / or in some cases closed off completely. The truth of the matter is that the COVID-19 pandemic is not only a humanitarian crisis, but a conservation crisis. With a number of tourism facilities having to temporarily close, the ground presence in wildlife areas will now be far less than before. Added to this with limited funding, we are currently hamstrung to be able to offer the conservation support we have done in the past, and are currently battling to maintain the salaries of our scouts. We fully understand the financial pressures and strain that this pandemic has bought to both businesses and individuals alike, but we are appealing to those who have the means to please support us to be able to continue with the vital work we do and the support we offer to the wildlife and habitats in this region.

The funds will be used to pay for legal fees and other expenses to preserve this tree. If we save this tree now, it could stand for countless generations to come. Your support shows the city that this tree matters to you and should be left standing.??Here?ôs the issue:?The city is mandating the removal of a 100+ foot, 100+ year old, ~100,000 pound, 9' diameter, healthy giant sequoia on our property in NE Portland (near 12th and Mason). It is likely one of the largest trees in all of Portland! The neighboring house is too close to the tree and on-going issues have not been addressed. There is shared ownership of the tree between the two properties. The neighboring house has been tagged uninhabitable for 3 years and is now on temporary shoring. The neighboring house could be moved, sold or deconstructed.? The city served us a tree code violation without ever speaking to us about this issue. ?We?ôve spent the last decade trying to collaborate with our neighbor on ways to keep to the tree and fix his house. Removing this tree will not fix this house.Our steps:?Request administrative review of this decision, which we can follow with an appeal, if necessary, and more steps after that. Continue to work toward resolutions with the city and the neighbor to solve his ongoing issues without involving the tree.?Why does it matter?The power of wild spaces in urban places.?The importance of grandmother trees in the urban canopy.The power of humans to get together and find creative solutions to disagreements.?There are many benefits of trees that the sequoia can only provide standing! Provide oxygen and reduce pollution, prevent erosion, filter stormwater and reduce stormwater runoff, provide shade, a visual screen and buffering from wind, storms and noise, sustain habitat for birds and other wildlife, maintain property values, contribute to the beauty, character and natural heritage of Portland, and preserve the urban canopy. Keep Portland Green!Here?ôs what you can do about it:?It?ôs time to demand that the city listen, think creatively and solve this problem another way.?Contact Urban Forestry at the City of Portland to tell them you want the tree to stay!Reference Case # 19-205171-000-00-UFPhone: 503-823-TREE (8733)??Contribute to GoFundMe: Sequoia Standing?Follow and share on social media : IG @sequoiastandingSign this petition here: https://bit.ly/2SrQasO No need to ""chip in"" at change.org.?

At the time we bring this to you, the exchange rate is 1$aus= 1,511tz shillings.And the fact is; one dollar can do much more than you think.Kisampa is a community run conservation area covering about 60 square kilometers, and growing. It is no secret that?Kisampa? ?(as well as many other community based conserved areas) is in dire straits without the support of the people who visit.? Things such as paying the salaries of the staff, the concession fees and buying things to aid in conservation efforts will become a struggle this year as tourism has fallen off a cliff and there is absolutely no cash flow.? As a result we are very concerned as to how we will manage to protect the conservancy as we don't expect to see paying guests at Kisampa well into 2021.As Mwalimu (teacher) Julius K. Nyerere said in his Arusha Manifesto, 1961:??òThe conservation of wildlife and wild places calls for specialist knowledge, trained manpower and money, and we look to other nations to cooperate with us in this important task - the success or failure of which not only affects the continent of Africa but the rest of the world as well.?ô¬†So, we are here to show you that: one dollar can...-If you donate 1$, it will pay for one meal for one of our staff members. That is already a valuable thing that could have simply been lying around in your pocket!?- If you can get 30 people to donate 1$, we can buy a pair of new boots for our anti-poaching team, or send out one foot patrol on the conservancy; potentially picking up 1 snare, which could be saving 1 animal.??-If 100 people donate 1$, one member of staff will be able to feed their family for a whole month. Having an income and being able to feed their families, indirectly protects Kisampas??wildlife because people do not have to turn to more drastic measures to get through these hard times. Each member of staff supports multiple people in in their villages; from their direct family, to extended family, the person they buy their maize from and their family, and so on.??-If 156 people donate 1$, we will be able to buy one of our most valuable anti-poaching assets: a camera trap.?If we start talking about even bigger goals:?-If 470 people donate 1$, we can pay the concession fee for Kisampa for one month!?-If 2800 people donate 1$, we will be able to keep employing all the staff on for one month.??-Finally, if we manage to get 33,600 people to spare 1$, we can ensure the future of Kisampa through these uncertain times.??There is no denying the power of social media to diffuse information, both quickly and over a large scale. This is why we would equally appreciate you sharing our message to as many people as you can.We are a group of students and friends who have all had the privilege of meeting each other and spending time at Kisampa. We are lucky to be able to be chasing our future dreams, but right now we want to focus on ensuring the future and livelihood of people we care about; the Kisampa team.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

462,Turning the tide on TB: Supporting the San Bushman,"Created May 2, 2020",Environment,"¬£10,000","¬£11,107",167,683,167,"The San people of southern Africa, believed to be the longest surviving culture on earth by tens of thousands of years and the last tribe on earth to pursue the persistence hunt, have faced centuries of oppression and marginalisation. The Ju??hoansi, the San people living in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy, now face a critical struggle against tuberculosis, a treatable and preventable disease. This crowdfunder aims to raise money to support local efforts to beat this disease. The money raised will pay for projects which provide vital food, information and testing which is necessary to eliminate TB and support good recovery. The projects had a private funder, but she recently died, and government and NGOs have not picked up the funding shortfall. In addition, the collapse of tourism in the Nyae Nyae due to COVID19 has caused a major fall in local income, meaning this crowdfunder is more important than ever.?The San culture is under threat from many directions, but TB is particularly dangerous. It is the leading cause of death from any infectious disease worldwide and there are four strains of TB in the region. We?ôre working with organisations and doctors on the ground the Nyae Nyae to make sure this money gets to the right people at the right time.?The priority is to provide food for recovering TB patients as eating regular good food is essential for the treatment to work. Government funding pays for medicines distributed by the clinic in Tsumkwe, which serves the whole of the Nyae Nyae. However, this funding does not provide accommodation or food. There is a separate soup kitchen project which provides nutritious meals twice a day in Tsumkwe to TB patients, but it is facing massive funding cuts. The soup kitchen urgently requires ¬£500 a month to continue to provide this vital service. Funding is also desperately required for an outreach team that carries out testing and education in the remote villages. As we've learned from COVID19, testing is an important part of controlling infectious disease. The outreach team can identify the disease in the early stages, which limits the spread of infection within the villages. This outreach team requires ¬£300 a month to operate.Since TB flares up when people are malnourished or otherwise immuno-compromised, the longer term aim is to tackle food security.? One vision to do this is to support the San to create gardens and food forests within each of the 39 villages in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy.? Seeds, fencing materials and tree saplings are needed to establish a garden in each of them. If we exceed our fundraising target, the additional money will be put towards these gardens and forests. If you are able to help fund this work in the longer term, please get in touch by contacting Caspar through the link below. More on the SanThe San people of the Kalahari are the last trace of our deep ancestry, our oldest cousins who never left Africa. Their territories span Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. In the last few centuries the nomadic lives these people led have been dramatically transformed through waves of colonialism and marginalisation that has put pressures on their land, and many are now settled in villages or only semi-nomadic.Amongst the San are some of the best trackers and hunters in the world. Men and women can still walk into the bush with their digging sticks and come out with forage hides laden with food. However, their shrinking territory and the fact that they are settled in villages, means living off foraging and hunting alone is not enough. Money, necessary to supplement limited hunting and foraging, is hard to come by. The main sources of income are searching in the desert for the Devil?ôs Claw plant and tourism. With COVID19, it will be a long time before tourism returns to the Kalahari.?About usWe are a group of people passionate about supporting the Ju'/hoansi as many of us have spent time with them through the Old Way and / or Wildwise over the last few years. There is so much we can learn from a culture as old as humanity itself and we would love to support the people who shared so much with us.

I learned by watching my mother and grandmother and imitating their designs. I also asked a lot of questions.? I began giving my mother rugs to sell when I was 6 years old. I never went to the store. I stayed at home to do chores. The rugs took me time to weave. As I got older, I improved my skills.?There were no stores like we have these days. We traveled on horse and wagons. We had trading posts that were far away and we traded for what we needed. We did not get paid in cash for rugs. We got food and other items. We lived in sheep camps and set up loom stands under the trees that we made with any kind of branch or cedar post even though it was crooked. When we finished our rugs we moved somewhere else and was always working on rugs and herding sheep.?In the Spring time we sheared our sheep. Before I weave a rug, I know how much I need to card, spin and dye. Then, when I get enough wool I am ready to weave and I start weaving in any season. Weaving is my life.

474,A place to call home,"Created July 6, 2020",Environment,"$80,000 ","$10,260 ",23,180,23,"A place to call home??We are a young family of four with the great Australian dream of having a place of our own. A place to call home. Working hard and saving hard, we still couldn?ôt get our foot in the door of the Sydney housing market. We lowered our expectations but after attending an auction for a tiny townhouse in Ambarvale near Campbelltown and having even that sell for $100,000- over the reserve price due to an investor bidding war we realised we would have to go back to the drawing board. So in March 2017 we found a little block of land in Warrawong. Not a new housing estate or anything fancy. Just a little block of land in an older established street with a mix of old homes and newer ones. A sloping block which we knew would have its headaches but it was something we could afford. We knew it would add an hour and a half travel each way to our jobs everyday being so far out of Sydney (near Port Kembla) but we could make a go of it. We could build a little home of our own for our family. We purchased the land from a family who had inherited it from their mum, who had bought three blocks in the same street many years before, but it had never been built on. So our little block of virgin land, in the middle of our very ordinary street was the start of our dream for a home of our own. We had our first son and worked hard towards the deposit for our house while paying interest only on our loan for the land. After a time we got a little surprise named Selene and our family became four. With the cost of child care our savings couldn?ôt grow so I changed careers and started working nights in hospitality. We moved in with my parent?ôs in-law so we could save, save, save. We talked to the bank about a loan for the house, but the bank said no.? So, I worked hard and waited. Finally, we went to the bank again, ready this time. Ummm sorry, the bank said. We?ôve changed our lending criteria. You don?ôt earn enough for the loan for your house anymore. Downhearted, I went back to the drawing board to come up with a plan which turned out to be a second job for me. So I worked two days a week and 30 + hours of nights and weekends, with two kids under the age of four and again had to wait for the bank to be happy. Finally the bank said yes, our hard work had paid off, we would finally have a home to call our own.Our builder who had now waited two years while we jumped our financial hurdles could finally start building our house. We were ecstatic. I?ôd worked myself to the bone, exhausted physically and emotionally but my perseverance had paid off. In December 2019 on the first day that the excavation commenced to clear a site ready for the foundation of our house, our dreams came crashing down. Our little block of virgin land was CONTAMINATED. It turns out that back in 2007 when the neighbour next door did an extension, added a sub floor and partial demolition on his house, he used the neibouring land as a storage and waste facility, land filling and dumping the waste onto the adjacent land, the land we had later been sold.All this waste buried and hidden under the soil. Broken roof tiles and bricks. Concrete and rio. Electrical wiring and bathroom tiles. You name it, he left some behind. Just recently we even found two, four metre long storm water pipes buried along the back fence line. The worst nasty thing left behind was the Chrysotile Cement Sheeting. Yes, ASBESTOS. Scattered throughout the entire block of land when it was land filled. CONTAMINATING all of it. Not knowing what to do, I approached both the Council and EPA (Environmental Protection Authority) each one passing the buck back and forward to the other. Eventually after 17 weeks of investigation by the EPA. A notice was issued to the neighbour for information. An admittance from the neighbour that the building waste was his. A number of witness statements about the neighbours use of the land was obtained as well. At this point I was so hopeful for justice - what could go wrong with an admittance and witnesses? Apparently this was not enough... the EPA refused to issue him with a clean up notice, stating that the Illegal dumping happened too long ago for them to care. Sorry...what?? He illegally contaminated an entire block of land but no-one is going to make him clean it up?Quotes to have the contaminated soil removed range from $100,000- to $150,000- The kind of money we just don?ôt have, a lifetime of savings. All this going on while we pay for a mortgage on a house we can?ôt build until the contamination is gone. Trying to find a way to clean up this mess with our near zero budget we recently hired some equipment and tried to clean the soil ourselves. Our whole family dedicated their time and we spent 10 straight days sifting approx. 80 tonnes of soil. First through a screening machine and then going through all 80 tonnes by hand to remove the asbestos pieces. Some as small as my pinky fingernail. It was a monumental effort. Ten days of hard slog, all the while still working nights for me and relying on family to help mind the children. 80 tonne of soil. And there?ôs still approx. 40 tonne as yet not touched. We were praying that our efforts would be enough. That the soil we?ôve cleaned by hand won?ôt have any asbestos fibres in it. That we could get a hygienist to test it and say that its OK....So far no hygienist will even test it for us. They say, just pay to have it taken away. During this whole year so far, our nefarious neighbour has refused to even have a conversation with us. I made countless calls to his home and he never once answered his phone. Never once called me back. But recently I managed to finally catch up with him. After a long day of screening soil and hand-picking contaminated waste. As I sat in my car with my sister getting ready for the long drive home, out he came. We watched as he brought out his dogs, walked them over to my property. Took them right up to the temporary fence erected by the builders in the middle of the access driveway. ....So they could defecate there. All the while taking his time to sticky beak through the fence while he waited for them to finish their business. So now we?ôve come to a stalemate. ¬∑ The EPA won?ôt help us, even though their own legislation states that what has been done is a criminal offence. ¬∑ The council ignores us. ¬∑ The conveyancer who oversaw the contract between us and the seller won?ôt provide us with the documents that might show that the sellers lied to us when they stated the land was clean. ¬∑ The neighbour is an owner builder, so there?ôs no company to go after for reparation. ¬∑ The certifier for the neighbours build and renovation was de-certified some time ago (I wonder why?) ¬∑ All the certifying documents that should be on file with the council are apparently mysteriously blank. The information that should be there to show what the neighbour did with his waste simply doesn?ôt exist. ¬∑ The ombudsmen hasn?ôt responded to the two letters I?ôve written. ¬∑ Our legal advisors are trying to make sense of the multitude of negligent actions taken across a wide range of persons involved that allowed this to happen at all. Another cost we are trying to afford. All we want to do, is build our home and move forward with our lives. With broken hearts we ask you humbly, Please help us if you can.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This project resides on land that has been stewarded by the Watkins-Wallace-Battle-Nash family lineage for 130 years and was originally stewarded by the Catawba and Tuscarora peoples prior to land displacement by European settlers. In the 1890s, Olivia?ôs great aunt and uncle came into stewardship of this land to provide a place for them to live and self-sustain. They grew potatoes, cabbage, collards, corn, goat, cow, lady smith tomatoes, pears. In the mid-1950s Olivia?ôs grandfather, Oliver, put in a well and electricity when power lines were first built down the road. He was an engineer and received his degree from NC A&T where he met Olivia?ôs grandmother, Ruth. They would visit the land between their international trips for work and decided to stay living abroad in search of economic opportunity. Olivia?ôs great aunt passed away in the 70s and since then it has since been vacant and managed as a timber farm until April 2019. when Olivia, representing the fifth generation of her family, returned to the land to continue her ancestral legacy as a farmer and forest steward. The land we steward is a 39.9-acre forest. We currently are growing shiitake mushrooms on 130 sweetgum logs and manage the woods for timber. We sell these mushrooms dry or fresh through direct-to-customer deliveries or social media.?Olivia has been farming for the past 6 years on regenerative agriculture systems in South Korea, Cook Islands, New Zealand, Hawai'i, New York, and now North Carolina. She currently is in her last year of her MBA program at North Carolina State University studying Financial Management.?The GoalIn the next 5 years, we would like to have a 1,000 shiitake mushroom log operation, a 0.5-acre plot of perennials and annuals, and a 5 hive apiary within the forest. Perennials include elderberry, persimmon, currants, pecan, and hazelnut. We will be selling 75% of the produce direct-to-consumer and 25% of the produce wholesale. Direct-to-consumer will be a combination of e-commerce sales and consumer deliveries. A portion of the cleared plot will be rented to young farmers who are interested in growing but do not have access to land or infrastructure.The SituationWhile my family lived on this land until the 70s, the property is still significantly underdeveloped to have a fully functioning and efficient farm. There is no road access or infrastructure.The mushroom yard is about 150 ft from the road down a slope with a steep 13ft elevation drop. As a result, anytime work needs to be done on the farm, Olivia uses a wheelbarrow to transport generators, tools, etc. back and forth from her car parked on the side of the road to the mushroom yard site. We have reached out to several banks that provide loans to small business and agriculture business but Oliver?ôs Agroforest did not qualify due to age of business (under 5 years). We are asking you for support to raise the capital infrastructure funds needed in order to make the farm fully operational.The Projects1)?Pre-build: Survey and site map of land to identify property boundaries to receive building permits, building permit fees ($6,600)2) Laying the foundation: grading, clearing 1 acre, 150 ft road installation ($8,000)3) Water systems: installing rain catchment system and well ($3,000)4) Perennial and annual system installation: 8x 50ft rows of perennials and space for annuals ($5,000)5) Barn build: Space for processing, packing, and storing product and shop ($60,000)6) House build: For farm workers of Oliver's Agroforest ($100,000)TimelineWe are currently in the process of finalizing a contract with a surveyor for the pre-build phase.

The Belize Jaguar Project is a long-term camera trapping study started by Dr. Marcella Kelly, professor, mentor, and renowned felid ecologist in 2002 making it one of the world?ôs longest running studies. As a team of researchers from the US and Belize, we study population dynamics of the beautiful and threatened jaguar. We aim to benefit jaguar conservation in Belize by providing annual population estimates to figure out if numbers are decreasing, increasing, or are stable. We also study how jaguars use the environment and how humans potentially affect their habitat and populations. ?Our work contributes to policies to protect this important species at the top of the food chain and ultimately the priceless habitats in which they, and countless other species, live.This year, our long-term monitoring project has hit a roadblock due to the COVID-19 pandemic, causing our field project to experience economic hardship due to cuts in scientific grants and other funding sources. Usually we have little trouble funding our surveys, but this year is exceptional and we do not want to miss a year of data collection. Funds would go towards our vital day -to-day operations to keep the project alive such as fueling and maintaining field trucks, paying for/fixing field cameras that break due to harsh weather, and food and lodging for volunteers and project leaders.?We will need donations ASAP to run our winter survey in the unique Mountain Pine Ridge Reserve of Belize starting January 1st, 2021.

486,help Scraps keep scrappin',"Created March 25, 2020",Environment,"$15,000 ","$9,570 ",88,137,88,"It's been a tumultuous few weeks, and there's more to come. We hope you are able to contribute to our team's survival as we weather the effects of the ongoing response to the coronavirus pandemic.Like so many? small businesses in our community, Scraps has been knocked sideways by the impacts of the coronavirus. With Denver's restaurants forced to all but close their doors, Scraps has lost more than 90% of our restaurant customers, accounting for nearly 1/3 of our revenues. With all non-essential businesses ordered to work from home, we are also losing the majority of our office customers - another 1/3 of our revenues. And with so many people losing their jobs, laid off and on furlough, we've also lost a number of residential customers who can no longer afford composting in their budgets - and we expect to lose more. This is also the season when we typically expect a boost from all of the zero-waste events we are contracted to service, and in turn contract dozens of zero-waste staffers for the spring & summer; for now, all of those event schedules are on an indefinite hold.The scale & abruptness of this impact has been staggering for us, as I'm sure it has been for you all. We have been responding as quickly & appropriately as we can, applying our characteristic ""scrappiness"" in all sorts of new ways in order to keep our doors open. We've asked for temporary rent forgiveness at our office and our sheds/garages, and we've dramatically scaled back our purchase & use of our more costly goods, such as compostable bags. We've paused all new purchases of marketing materials and canceled all non-essential meetings, trainings and other activities. We've been mixing our own cleaner and hand sanitizer, utilizing our stock of gloves and plastic bags from last event season (it kills us to use plastic to line bins!, but keeping costs low is critical), and we continue to modify our protocol so we can service our remaining customer base safely & in accordance with all public health guidelines. We've offered our residential customers a three-month prepay option; dozens of folks who know they'll be able to continue composting have opted for this prepay, which has brought us a much-needed cushion to help us navigate these uncertain times. (To those of you who have, we thank you!) And we continue to promote our residential & drop-off programs especially, in anticipation of continuing those services even as we wait (and hope) for offices & restaurants to return to ""normal.""Unfortunately, we are still facing critical revenue shortfalls in order to meet both our high fixed costs (insurance alone costs us thousands of dollars per month) and be able to pay our small, incredibly hardworking team. We are reaching out to ask for your support for our staff. We are a team of just three full-time and one part-time employees, who until last week were servicing more than 600 Scraps members around the Denver area. With this emergency fund, we are hoping to supplement our revenue shortfalls (and anticipated payroll shortfalls) in order to provide our staff with the resources they need to pay for their housing, food, utilities & other basic needs during this difficult time. It is our hope that this fund will help us keep our staff employed, keep our minimum operations running, and bounce back from this crisis when it ends, bringing offices, restaurants, and other affected businesses and individuals back into our Scraps family as quickly as possible. And we are cooking up ideas to thank you for your generosity! Whether through a party (when we can all be social again!), discounted Scraps service, promotions through our partner organizations, or otherwise - we hope to be able to make it up to you soon. You've all done so much to help us launch, nurture & grow this business over the past three-plus years, and your support now would mean the world to us.Each and every one of us is affected by this public health crisis in some way, and we know the need for support is deep & widespread across our community. We know you have a choice in whether and how to support those in need, and we appreciate every dollar that you are able to spare our small business! And we are still here for you, to support you however we can, as well. Together we can make it through this trying time, and surely emerge an even stronger community.

Together,"Created October 31, 2020",Environment,"??5,000","??,607",164,407,164,"Dear Reader,A few words about us and the vision we are trying to turn into reality:Plastic Fischer was founded by Georg, Karsten and Moritz, after we witnessed large amounts of river plastic flowing through the Mekong Delta in Vietnam in December 2018.Realizing first hand how much waste is entering the oceans every single day was the moment we decided to take action ourselves.We wanted to develop locally built solutions.?No high-tech. No priority on fancy design.Impact before everything has always been our focus.Without detailed knowledge about rivers or the waste economy, but highly motivated to find a solution for a global issue within a developing country, Moritz and Karsten moved to Indonesia in June last year.Our starting point was the most polluted river in the world: The Citarum River, in Bandung, Indonesia.After months of research, Moritz invented the TrashBoom. A simple, low-cost, but extremely effective swimming barrier which stops the vast majority of waste floating in the river.They are not just a concept, we proved that they work and fulfill their mission to protect the oceans from waste! While collecting a lot of plastic from the river, we understood that what we were fighting symptoms, caused partially by a lack of education on plastic pollution. We value the educational part as equally important to collecting it from rivers if we want to achieve a sustainable change and create a real impact on the situation.Sometimes, people just don?ôt know, or forgot, that there is an alternative to plastic.We will host free plastic workshops for the river community to raise awareness on this topic!This being said, our GoFundMe objective is to:? ? ? ? ? - Build a sorting facility? ? ? ? ? - Deploy more TrashBoom systems? ? ? ? ? - Hire full-time employees? ? ? ? ? - Educate by hosting plastic workshopsWith a successful campaign, we will be able to execute these steps in Indonesia, the world?ôs second-biggest pollutant.If we would be able to reach even more than our announced goal, we will be able to deploy more systems, host more workshops, and create more impact.Thank you for helping and caring, so that your kids and grandkids will have those beautiful oceans to swim in as we had as a kid.PS:?We would love to give you something in return, even though it is not meant to be like this on GoFundMe. 25??

Maritza was born & raised in ?úLa Laguna??which is a Communidad Indigena in the mountains of San Ramon. San Ramon is one of many areas that are included in the ?úTerritorios Indigena Matagalpa '', and the majority of Matagalpan people remain primarily in these outskirt mountain communities, like La Laguna.?In western Nicaragua there are no Tribal I.D. cards, and your claim to your indigeneity is based on what indigenous community you're born in & your parents lineage within that community/pueblo. Furthermore when living in an indigenous community, you get access to certain benefits provided by your ?úPueblo Indigena/Tribal Government??& if you move outside of the community/territory access to the Pueblo?ôs resources may vary.In terms of indigenous rights, the lead coordinator Maritza Centeno, has been representing various indigenous Nicaraguan communities of the ?úPacifico, Centro, y Norte'' at the United Nations since 2015. She has been a part of Movimiento Ind√≠gena Nicaragua (M.I.N.) since 2010 & has been asked to internationally represent them on multiple occasions. Maritza has worked with various Indigenous Central American Organizations, most notably La Comisi√≥n de Pueblos Ind√≠genas y Afrodescendientes del Parlamento Centroamericano y la Organizaci√≥n NALEB & has served as the lead coordinator of the Jornadas de Paz y Dignidad Nicaragua.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Who else in the community is involved??The community?ôs Women Coop, have fought, and succeeded in prioritizing femme led organic farming projects & in this campaign they are the legal, and organizational backbone. The Cooperativa is made up of 21 different mujeres ranging in age from teens to great-grandmothers, so having this intergenerational support has been monumental.?úGuardianes del Bosque - Colibr√≠ de la Noche/Huitzi Yohualli?? the community's youth healing circle has been fundamental within the campaign in raising awareness & standing against the lack of respect fellow adult community members have towards the mountain side, and the use of religion to minimize ancestral care for the land.?Both groups will be co-creating the terms of the Micro-Reserve that legally will prevent outsiders or community members from mining or logging.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I thought indigenous land in Nicaragua was collectively owned? Why would miners be allowed if the community disagreed? Why is this Reserve going to be in the name of a collective & not the whole entire community??Comunidad Ind√≠gena de La Laguna, located in San Ramon, is one of many communities found in Indigenous Matagalpan Territory. Throughout this Territory there are vast differences in land titles, & the 2 major differences are individual titles & communal titles.Due to colonialism past and present there are parts of this Territory where individual land owners (Indigenous, Mestizo, International Immigrants) have complete ?úlegal??individual titles. Some of these titles were purchased in the 1800's (therefore current owners inherited it) & others bought titles throughout the huge political shifts of Nicaragua over the past century.Communal Titles, which are the standard in indigenous tradition, vary by pueblo & ultimately center cooperative living.?La Laguna, is the latter, which means they stewards the land within their Collective Title & each family/ individual within the community has their own rights to their parcelas / plots of land that they tend to.These rights give the families/individuals the sovereignty to decide what happens to their parcelas/ plots of land.?They can sell their land rights to neighbors, rent their land rights to outsiders, pass the rights to grandchildren,? grow organic food, use gallons of pesticides, plant trees, cut trees, build a Church, build a healing clinic, etc. all at their discretion.Unfortunately, due to colonization & disconnection from ancestral tradition, some community members (mostly men in their 30s-50s) see the parcelas/plots of land as nothing more than potential profit. When approached & bated by miners during Covid-19, they saw this as a perfect opportunity to put their land rights to use & allow miners to enter and extract from the land.So these funds will be used to obtain rights from individuals already selling or contemplating selling/renting rights to the Miners. They get compensated for the titles & the mountain rights no longer stay in the hands of individuals working with/ contemplating collaboration with miners.These newly obtained rights will be in the name of the newly formed collective made up of community members dedicated to the protection & stewardship of the land. This collective will be a branch from the communities Women?ôs Coop., & in collaboration with the communities youth healing circle, which will then have legal documentation prohibiting any form of mining & abuse of the land. There has been talk for the past few years of the formation of this collective but with the increased mining the time is now where it is taking the formal steps to getting legal recognition.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~What are Maritza?ôs (the project coordinator) ties and position with the current Nicaraguan government? What are her personal politics with the current uprisings in Nicaragua?First we would like to clarify that since colonization the indigenous people from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific have negotiated and fought an ancient battle with each elected government in Nicaragua. Treaties have been created and violated. Each indigenous persxn/community/tribe has had their own personal political views that shift & change depending on how the current govt. interacts with their needs & rights. With every new govt. some communities are supported & heard, & others neglected. We have heard the questions, and want to clarify that Maritza does not work with the Nicaraguan Government & continues to work first & foremost for her comunidad indigena, the rights of indigenous territories Pacifico, Centro, Norte & the protection of the Mother Earth.?In 2018 she did indeed denounce the uprisings, by formally expressing opposition to the ?útranques'' / walled protests that she believed caused more harm to indigenous people, physically & economically, then support. Maritza, nor the Women?ôs Coop., have never supported or condoned any violence on behalf of the government or palamitaries. For any type of organizing within Communidades Indigena de Pacifico, Centro, Norte it is understood that various views coexist, and it has been through dilagoue that now many have been able to intentionally hear each other's political points of views to take a firmer stand for humanity.?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Where can I find more information on the miners??The mining project in La Laguna is led by Sociedad Productiva y Comercial ?úCRISTO VIVE #2??Legal documentation & various pictures of the bagged raw material & mining trucks in the community have been obtained & shared with the coordinators of this campaign. Unfortunately & predictably the miners physically prohibit community members from dig sites & limit onsite investigation. There are multiple small mining operations throughout the area that intentionally limit our access to more information to who is financing their operations.?What is very common in Central America is small companies/ groups of men rent mining gear from bigger corporations & operate as ?úindividuals'' then take the raw materials back to larger mining companies to process. That way if any injury or lawsuits occur there is no ?úcorporate??tie to pay the fees & take responsibility.?La Laguna, La Reyna, La Pita, Wabule, El Horno, Monte Grande, El Naranjo are just a few out of many communities in Matagalpan Territory that are impacted by these mining operations as we speak.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFO OR WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW YOU CAN SUPPORT ON THE FRONT LINESPLEASE EMAIL MARITZA & FOLKS ON THE GROUND - [email redacted]Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

490,Help Save Our Forest Farm,"Created May 26, 2020",Environment,"$20,000 ","$9,095 ",65,284,65,"? With our most humble and eternal gratitude, we are asking for help in saving the forest connected to ours. Our family?acquired?our part of this forest almost five years ago after the owners lived here for over forty years. We have been slowly learning the way of the woods and planting food where we could. The attached land is flatter and more open to sun and perfect for growing more food, herbs and flowers to make it back into our community. We are raising three children that we homeschool and they have all blossomed into artists, musicians and loving people. We have no doubt this land has helped them flourish. We decided we should acquire the land attached to us to become an official farm and save her from being cut down. We scraped up what we could and asked our families for help. We almost reached our goal and at the last minute a pivotal part fell through. Though we have most of the funds and plans that seem attainable, because of the current crisis banks aren't loaning money, especially for land loans. One of our biggest fears in asking for help is that we come across ungrateful for what we already have. But if part of this forest is destroyed it will weaken the ecosystem as a whole. The World is shifting, and we need to care for environments on a small scale as an example of how to care for our beautiful World on a larger scale. This forest shows us everyday that Nature is our teacher and we must take notes and listen. We don't feel that we own this forest, more that we are her caretakers. We love her so much and we can't imagine the thought of her being torn apart. We made a promise to protect this land and we feel like anything is worth a shot just to keep our promise. We're not asking for help you can't give, only help you can. Even sharing our story will help! This is a powerful time where we must all come together and make a brighter World. We have future plans of small music and art shows, as well as opening up the land for friends to teach classes. We have to start taking better care of Nature, our community and ourselves. We believe in this! We all have to start somewhere. Since we fell in love 25 years ago, we've had a vision of having land where our friends and family could seek solace if needed. Our intentions are mighty big, so we need your help! We have 10 days to raise the money that fell through. We are also selling many of our belongings to get the remainder. We have complete faith that if enough people can feel our passion, that something very special will occur. When life gets scary we crave love and comfort. This forest farm is all of that, with the bonus of giving back food and security. From the bottom of our family's heart, we thank you for any part you play in keeping this forest whole!So much love,Thom, Rose, Owen, Rider and Luella HornungRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve sanitation in light of the pandemic, all toilets will have handwashing stations (previously only some did) and they now will be serviced twice a week instead of once.

In August of 2019 at Grandview Beach in Encinitas, an oceanfront bluff suddenly collapsed and killed three members of the Davis family including his wife, daughter and sister-in-law who had gathered to celebrate her recent victory over breast cancer. McDermott and his daughter were on the beach that day and witnessed the frantic desperate efforts of first responders. He vowed in that fateful moment to never allow another preventable tragedy like the Davis family's to happen again.Almost a year later and many empty promises made, still nothing has been done to prevent future tragedies and destruction on our beaches...UNTIL NOW!

This San Diego-area tragedy followed similar preventable bluff collapse fatalities in 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2008.?The ?current coastal management strategy does not prioritize erosion mitigation, instead it actually enables bluff slides, failures, erosion, and collapses that will continue to kill people on our beaches and prohibit public access.?We need an effective and constructive path for locals to mitigate erosion of vertical bluff faces in densely populated coastal hazard zones to prevent further fatalities, injuries, infrastructure destruction, and emergency repair costs and litigation. ?Millions of people visit the beaches in this region each year but are forced to sit at the base of dangerous bluffs due to the lack of sand replenishment and minimal beach area during mid to high tides.SB 1090 will provide for a critical avenue to prevent further bluff-related tragedies from recurring. The addition of erosion mitigation strategies on the coastal bluffs will increase the amount of safe and secure coastal access on our beaches.

500,Protect Free Speech and Forest Lake From Casella,"Created April 24, 2020",Environment,"$10,000 ","$8,473 ",71,510,70,"**We have exceeded our fundraising goal AGAIN thanks to some offline donations, thank you everyone who has contributed to the defense of free speech and the right of environmental watchdogs to sound the alarm without the threat of being SLAPPED by a multi-billion dollar corporation in an effort to silence us!? We are in this together!? Jon 7/26/20----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My journey into the world of trash began on April 3rd, 2019.? A garbage company, Casella Waste Systems, Inc. of Rutland, VT came before the Town of Dalton Planning Board with what many and myself would call a very sneaky ""lot line adjustment"" relative to a large piece of land in which they have an option to purchase agreement with the current owner.? The intent of this ruse was to carve out a 50 ft ""buffer"" surrounding the future site of their planned 180-acre garbage landfill adjacent to Forest Lake and Forest Lake State Park.? The 50 ft swath of land would be retained by the original landowner in an effort to make him the ONLY abutter and thus, the only person to have to be notified when this unscrupulous, corporate predator submitted its permit applications to NH DES.? This would also remove the NH Division of Parks and Recreation from notification.? Nice introduction to the community, huh?? Fortunately, this effort failed as the Planning Board denied it.Since that fateful day, I have worked tirelessly for over a year in learning more about this company.? It has been an exhaustive year, with numerous sleepless evenings spent learning more and more about this company, its business practices, its history as a bad neighbor, and a bad business partner to numerous host communities who have had the misfortune of being host to one of Casella's garbage landfills.? This company's bad reputation precedes them, and only a smidgen of that information has been logged on the website I created, SaveForestLake.com, not long after that initial introduction on April 3rd.Subsequently, my efforts to oppose this terrible development gained supporters, as a vast majority of our North Country neighbors were made aware of the ill intentions of Casella Waste Systems and their plans to create a 180-acre landfill only 1/4 of a mile from the waters edge of Forest Lake.? What could go wrong, right?? We, the concerned citizens of the North Country, became an opposition movement and in partnering with others not only across the state, but across the country, have had a VERY successful year in raising awareness of the threat to come and throwing roadblocks in the path of this multi-billion dollar garbage profiteer.? Initially, I was told by Dalton town officials that there was NOTHING to be done because Dalton had no zoning.? However, I was informed of certain state laws that allow for adoption of Emergency Temporary Zoning by Special Election and I began a petition drive and gathered over 100 signatures.? Following that, Dalton residents voted to empower the Town of Dalton with RSA: 674:24-29 Emergency Temporary Zoning, as Casella preyed upon tiny and rural Dalton BECAUSE we had no zoning ordinance.? We enjoyed? a major victory in July, 2019, passing the measure 154-129, and despite the heavy-handed lobbying efforts of this company.? ?We even have a piece of state legislation, HB1319, that passed the NH House by a vote of 189-123 that would establish a 2-mile setback for the siting of any new landfills next to a NH State Park.? That bill now awaits the reconvening of the NH Senate for consideration in committee.??Fast forward to last week, when I was notified by the media, NOT the Coos County Sheriffs Dept, that I was being sued by Casella Waste Systems for defamation in a 16-page complaint.? The media notified me on the very same day the complaint was filed, April 14, 2020.? The media had been notified nearly a week before the Sheriffs Dept served me!? The media also received a press release AND an op-ed from Casella CEO John Casella!? Obviously, a PR stunt from a very desperate company as they have come to realize that thru our efforts to sound the alarm, they may find themselves homeless in New Hampshire in the very near future.? This lawsuit should be troubling to ALL of us as it seeks to silence me, and shut down my website.? A multi-billion dollar corporate entity based in Rutland, VT has decided it has had enough of my year-long effort to shine light on their dismal record and reputation.? I cannot help it their reputation precedes them.? Thank God for the Internet as we have been able to uncover so much about this company, its violations, plethora of lawsuits, and overall efforts to bully its way in host communities from NY to ME to achieve ITS goals, despite the will of those communities.? I have shared my opinions, based on the factual data and news reports I have uncovered, and have concluded that this is a bad company, with a very bad reputation, surrounded by controversy nearly everywhere it turns up, and this current threat to our North Country way of life needs to be broadcast far and wide.I only ask for your help because we are all in this together.? This development will not only impact our lives, it will negatively affect generations of North Country residents to come.? This is the perfect opportunity to send YET AGAIN another message to this corporate bully that they cannot silence our voice, we are a free people and have a right to be heard, and we do not want, nor need their 180-acre landfill in Dalton, NH.? In fact, over the course of my research, I have subsequently learned that our state actually does not need this importer of out of state waste at all as we have plenty of existing landfill capacity for decades to come, especially if we can rid ourselves of 1 of the 2 major importers and reduce what we waste as a society.? We do not need Casella Waste Systems in NH, Casella Waste Systems needs NH in order to succeed in its goal of creating a home for the future disposal needs of its garbage empire in Dalton.? I hope you will add your voice to mine and support my legal defense with whatever you can afford during these trying times.? Even a $5 donation helps, as you can send a message to Casella Waste Systems and tell them that the North Country will not be bullied into silence with this frivolous SLAPP lawsuit meant to harass and silence those opposed to their plans and presence.? Like the Northern Pass fight, we can win this if we stand together!Thank you,Jon SwanFounder, Save Forest Lake?(603) 991-2078[email redacted]http://www.SaveForestLake.comPlease Help Us To Save Forest Lake!?

501,Water Fund for Foragers Farms,"Created July 17, 2020",Environment,"$20,000 ","$8,420 ",158,246,158,"Tyler Davis and Erin Bodashefsky of Foragers Farms are in their fourth season as farmers on the land, living and working to grow healthy food, and a future for their 2 year old son, Cypress. Finding land that is financially accessible to young, first generation farmers is a challenge. In the search for farmable land, Erin and Tyler had to get resourceful and through connecting with local farmers found out about Farmlink.net, a website joining people to land opportunities. After multiple meetings, extensive research and land tours, the move was made in 2016 to Headwaters Community Farm and Education Center in Cobourg, Ontario. This was a great chance for them to get started on a beautiful piece of land close to a local market. It was also an opportunity to try and earn a living and find a place in this new community through growing a diversity of annual vegetables.?In their second year on the land, it became quite apparent that the water supply was insufficient for the needs of their 1 acre farm. With the intention of building the farm up to two acres of production in this space, this young family had to make a decision; either move the farm and start from scratch leasing land with water access, or wait to see if a dug well would yield water through spring fed aquifers. They decided to choose patience and remain at the place they had already begun to establish roots. This was also an easy choice considering the amazing relationships and connections that had been formed in the area. As it would turn out, after digging three 35??deep holes, no water was found.? Their farm on this beautiful space came up against some big hurdles. Complications with their water and land security made it tricky to navigate an already challenging endeavour as young, first generation farmers. They continued to persist with open hearts and minds to see where this journey would take them and what valuable lessons it would teach.?In the third season they made a strategy to use straw mulch and drip tape to conserve water. They connected two more cisterns (water tanks) to the barn to make a total of 3,500 gallons, and borrowed a friends trailer, outfitted with 2-1,000L totes and a gas pump with some fire hoses to collect water as a back up system. Using these tools they were able to successfully grow on 1.5 acres with mostly normal precipitation. At this point, the land has yet to be severed and by increasing their gardens to two acres they could start to think about how they would pay a mortgage and, one day after paying the bank, could own the means of production.?This brings us to the spring of 2020. With the sudden outbreak of Covid-19, Erin and Tyler worked diligently to adjust to the changes caused by the pandemic and continued to provide their community with the freshest, healthiest food possible. The pandemic brought even greater uncertainty to small-scale farmers as markets were closed down and have only recently begun to open up to a steadier pace. The markets are not only a great place for the community to access the freshest food, but are a valuable opportunity to connect and engage with the humble hearts and hands behind the process.?Aside from the pandemic, this year has thrown another hurdle towards Erin and Tyler and many others farmers. A severe drought is facing Ontario and after 6 weeks with hardly any rain the crops are struggling and the team at Foragers Farms are depleting their physical resources. Collecting water and modifying the irrigation system has became a full time job and is still not enough to give all the crops a sufficient amount of water. This system has become Erin and Tyler's only way of getting water to the gardens, besides ordering water on a truck which has been extremely costly and exhausting. Your contribution would help Erin andTyler cover the costly expenses of irrigation and would also provide invaluable encouragement and a greater sense of communityand support.?In the midst of a global pandemic, it is more vital than ever that we support organizations and communities working to protect and conserve this beautiful Earth and planet we call home. Food security, sovereignty, and sustainability have always been close to Erin and Tylers heart and a huge part of their mission. The folks at Foragers Farms are more than just farmers, they are caretakers of the land and believe in natural growing practises and living with great respect for nature and future generations.?We are reaching out to our communities for help and we hope, if you are able, you will support us during these challenging times. This work feeds our souls and allows us to provide and be of service in very meaningful ways for which we are so grateful. It is our dream to see this farm and the relationships it has created sustained. There is still so much more we hope to give back to the land and the community, and we are inspired each day by the beauty and grace which surrounds us. If we can connect to, heal, and nurture the land, it will in turn heal and nurture us.""The biggest challenge we face now is not unlike what most of the world?ôs farmers are battling with. Access to viable farmland and capitol to invest in the complex systems needed to operate an ecological diverse farm. We are being asked to take on massive amounts of debt in order to own the means of production, meanwhile the cost of food is at an all time low. All of our earnings and profits get invested back into the farm year after year, and farmers are being forced to leverage the land to maximize production in order to stay afloat.We are asking you to invest in the ones that are willing and able to do the work necessary for all of us to thrive and stay healthy in this ever changing world. We will, with a close eye on the changes of season, sow the seeds of the future. We, the protectors of space held for all earths beings; we, the builders of soil, the bringers of water, the sowers of seed, witness the beauty of creation and the horror of destruction for what it?ôs truly worth.?We ask you to empower us with peace by protection, choice by inclusion through financial endowment and grace us with your being through work done by your hands guided by your hearts. We are asking you to invest in us.??- Tyler DavisERIN AND TYLER TALK ABOUT FORAGING AND FARMING: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBo5CZ0UgKc&feature=youtu.be?The Real Cost of the Farm?1. Purchase the necessary equipment used and refurbished to pump water approx. 4000??to irrigate crops. This will allow Foragers to add this system to increase the resiliency of their irrigation capacity. In combination with their 1.5 hp electric pump and cisterns collecting rain water, we would no be able to irrigate the farm from a pond. Cost $15,000?2. Compact Tractor and implements. This tool will allow us to create our own compost and spread that fertility efficiently. It will be used for earthworks to open up new land for annual vegetables and incorporate overcrops to feed soil life. This type of intense work is something we feel as farmers feeding cities can help balance the workload and help us to farm longer into life. In order to have good fertility and build soil in the first years 90 tonnes of compost /acre is needed. We currently move this using buckets and a small utility vehicle and the worms love it!? Cost $70,0003. 20% down on a farm property approx value $550 000. We will continue farming and growing food at any scale but as next generation Canadian farmers if we don?ôt have access to land then who does? And how is that land being managed by people who don?ôt live with it or see life there as being valuable. ? Cost $110,000?4. Water Systems. Drill a well Cost $10,000, Dig a pond Cost $5,000, Under ground pipe and hydrants Cost $3,500. For 1?ô‚Ä?of saturation we need 26,000 gal / acre / week.

504,KEEP CITY LIGHTS BOOKS ALIVE,"Created April 9, 2020",Business & Entrepreneurs,"$300,000 ","$495,603 ",10.3K,62.9K,10.4K,"A Message from Elaine Katzenberger, Publisher and CEO of City Lights Booksellers & Publishers:?When Lawrence Ferlinghetti tells the story of founding City Lights Bookstore in 1953, he talks about meeting a need. At that time, he says, there was no public place for writers and readers to experience community in San Francisco, and his goal was to create a ?úliterary meeting place??where all would feel welcome. He stocked his new bookshop with affordable paperbacks and kept City Lights open late hours as a way to provide the opportunity for working folks and bohemian types alike to partake in the scene and to mingle with each other. The idea was an immediate success, as the city?ôs intellectuals and literati quickly made the bookshop their home base and meeting ground. As Ferlinghetti says, ?úOnce we opened up the doors, we could hardly get them closed at night, the place was always packed!?ùFast forward to 2020, and although much has changed in our city and our world, City Lights is still a vital and beloved literary hangout. Each year thousands of people from out of town and around the world make it a point to visit, and our rich community of Bay Area authors, poets and avid readers consider the bookstore a second home, an essential key to a sense of belonging. At this point, almost 70 years since its founding, there are multiple generations, local and distant, who derive a sense of comfort and inspiration from simply knowing that a place like City Lights can still exist, a place that?ôs driven by ideals, unwavering in its commitment, grounded in a utopian vision of the potential for human creativity to make a better, richer world for all. A steady beacon, City Lights is there whenever we need a place to feel at home with our fellow humans, their ideas and aspirations, their curiosities and their wild dreams of a new beginning. In fact, for many of us, a world without City Lights is something we don?ôt want to imagine. For me, personally, it hurts to think of that.I have had the huge privilege of spending 33 years at City Lights, learning the crafts of bookselling and publishing, working on a project that feels irrefutably meaningful. During all that time, it has never once seemed possible that our momentum could falter and our project could fail, but we?ôre all in uncharted terrain now. City Lights is faced with formidable challenges at present: our bookstore has been closed to the public since March 16, and must remain closed for an indefinite period of time. Unlike some shops, we?ôre unable even to process online orders, since we want our booksellers to remain safely at home. With no way to generate income, our cash reserves are quickly dwindling, with bills coming due and with a primary commitment to our staff, who we sent home with full pay and healthcare, and who we hope to keep as healthy and financially secure as possible.I want to reassure you that we?ôre doing everything in our power to keep City Lights intact, and to position this beloved institution to play a vital role in what is for now a very uncertain future. We know how much we?ôre all going to need this place again, this home away from home where we can find each other once more, in person and in books. We?ôre exploring every means of possible support, including federal and local grants and loans, but these funds are not guaranteed to come in, and they won?ôt meet the needs of our short-term future. And so, we must humbly ask for your support. We know what a difficult and uncertain time this is for everyone, and we understand that there are many individuals and organizations in need. If you?ôre in a position to support us we?ôll be extremely grateful to receive that help, and any donation to this campaign will contribute to the cash resources we need to address the immediate future, to take care of our staff, and to create the structures to take City Lights into the future. And if you could let others know about this campaign, we?ôll appreciate that immensely, too.At City Lights we?ôre always trying to create the world we want to share with our community. We?ôre passionately committed to our roles as booksellers and publishers. On the shelves of our bookstore and in the titles we publish, we carefully represent a point of view that we believe will empower and enlighten, nurture the seeds of a more equitable, intelligent, and peaceful world. Our goal now is to find new ways to nurture and serve our community during this difficult time, and even in the face of formidable obstacles, we?ôre feeling inspired. Please be sure to stay in touch with us, keep an eye on our various social media channels, sign up for our newsletters, buy a City Lights title at your local bookstore if you can, or from our storefront on Bookshop?. Most of all, please drop us a line to let us know you?ôre out there. The messages of support and camaraderie are priceless.Books are a repository for human knowledge and creativity, and a bookshop is like a storehouse for our collective soul. Though it?ôs dark now, City Lights is there, quietly waiting for us, and when the doors can be opened once more to welcome everyone back inside, the bookstore will become a home again, a place to gather and celebrate together. Until then, please keep faith, read books, and know that we appreciate you so much.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to Covid we were a thriving business and had no debt. Then Covid hit and now at the end of our season, we are in debt and that debt will continue to rise quickly until Covid has passed and business returns to normal. We will celebrate our 50 year anniversary August 8, 2021 and are determined to make it to celebrate our 50th year anniversary. It is time to ask for help.WHAT HAPPENED?During the first half of our 6 month 2020 season, by state mandate we were not allowed to open in any capacity. We were disappointed that any of our safety plans, even private family tours, were not considered because we were classified as an amusement park. When we were allowed to open for the last half of our season, we were only allowed a capacity of 250 people including employees. Our park?ôs capacity is several thousand guests, so 250, including employees, does not begin to pay our bills.?We have been very responsible, with temperature checks, sanitizing rides between each rider, extreme sanitizing, even outside, closing areas of the park where proper social distancing or sanitizing cannot be maintained, online reservations to control and document capacity and much more. We have worked hard to cut our operating expenses in less than half, but even so, that small capacity leads us further and further into debt.?We are trying to be creative and exhaust all possible sources of income. We have put more items on our online store and started to auction off our father?ôs paintings, prints and memorabilia. This is why we have started our GoFundMe...to keep Enchanted Forest open to be enjoyed long after Covid is gone.?THE ENCHANTED FOREST STORYIn the 60's, Roger, father of four young children, realized there was very little for a family to see and do together in Oregon. He formulated the idea for a theme park where he could use his creative talents and though he had very little time or money to make his dream a reality, he persisted anyway. He purchased the original 20 acres of land off Interstate 5 for four thousand dollars, in monthly payments of fifty dollars and began construction in 1964. He worked full-time at the Oregon State Highway Department. However, to finance his dream, he repaired watches and took extra commercial art jobs in his spare time, buying one sack of cement at a time. He worked on building the park after work and on weekends. The Tofte's own backyard became filled with storybook figures and small buildings as Roger also used every spare second at home to work on his dream.Everyone but Roger thought it was foolish to think that this idea could work. Roger's friends and co-workers used to tease him about his work on ""Idiot Hill."" That also seemed to be the bank's idea. Close to opening, Roger and Mavis needed $2,000 to put on the last touches to the park in order to be able to open, but had run out of every last dime. Their own bank would not loan them the money, because, of course, the Tofte family didn't have any cash. Only one bank took the chance on them and loaned them the money.Roger originally thought it would take only two years to build the Storybook Trail, which was the first section that he needed to complete before the park could open. Finally, after seven years, at 2:00 on Sunday, August 8, 1971, Roger and his wife Mavis hung up a piece of butcher paper saying ""OPEN"" on the fence and the first visitors entered the park. Admission was one dollar for adults and fifty cents for children and the starting wage was $1.65 per hour. There were 75 people the first day and 1,000 people the next Sunday. Roger's dream was finally a reality with Roger as the creative force and Mavis as the business head.Roger?ôs wife Mavis was the business head of Enchanted Forest until diagnosed with cancer and handed off the day to day operations of running the business to daughters Susan and Mary when they were young adults.?Through the years, Roger and his family have been adding to his dream with new additions to the park. The Tofteville western town was built the second year, and the Haunted House opened in 1974. The Comedy Theatre was built for daughter Susan, who writes and directs the outrageous musical comedies based on fairy-tales and composes all park music.?Money was continually put back into the business creating more to see and do. Over the years many more attractions were added, the Ice Mountain Bobsled Roller Coaster, The English Village, the Fantasy Fountains water-light show, the Big-Timber Log Flume ride, kiddie rides, and the interactive target shooting ride, The Challenge of Mondor.?Now, Roger Tofte, though still the ringleader of Enchanted Forest, has successfully incorporated 2 of his children into the business, Susan and Mary, 2 of his grandchildren, Derek and Tim, Roger?ôs brother-in-law Dale and Tim?ôs wife, Ashley. According to Susan, this arrangement has worked out quite well, ""We're very lucky. We get along because we're each in charge of different projects and our areas don't overlap much. We work very well together.""THE FUTUREWith three generations of the Tofte family working at Enchanted Forest, the tradition and creativity will be carried on for many years to come with your help. Roger can still be seen almost daily out working in the park. If you see a man in his 90s riding around on a moped or repairing cement, it is probably Roger! As Roger says, "" We believe in attention to artistic detail. We want to offer our visitors something unique, with a lot of variety. We strive to be the hidden gem that people discover as their own special place.""?Our goal right now is to save the business and survive through Covid so we are here for future generations to enjoy. We have cut our operating budget to less than half of what it would be during a normal year, but even so, with a capacity of only 250 mandated by our our state, this does not begin to cover costs to keep us in business. We will keep working hard and use all of our creativity, but we have decided this is the time to ask for help.?For more information about Enchanted Forest go to:enchantedforest.comTo see the video interview with family member and park Co-manager Susan Vaslev with Aaron Mesh from Willamette Week go to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbi6RbVxmlM&feature=emb_logo?CONTRIBUTIONS OR GIFTS TO ENCHANTED FOREST, INC.

Your generous contributions helped us cover health care for our employees and bridge the costs while our stores were closed. Now that Amoeba San Francisco and Amoeba Berkeley are open again, we are ending the campaign.A Brief History of Amoeba Music?30 years ago, Amoeba Music founders Dave Prinz and Marc Weinstein had a crazy idea. Let?ôs open up an independent record store, beholden to no corporate interests, that could become a gathering place for the musical community. A record store that would have an affordable mix of new and used product, that could serve as a trading post where people could bring in any unwanted music or movies for cash or trade.So we rented a space on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley that had been shuttered for years. And we spent the summer of 1990 going to flea markets, garage sales and running a tiny classified in the SF Chronicle that netted us some truly amazing collections. And we put that store together. Piece by piece.Many of our friends thought we were crazy too. We were going up against some very formidable stores - Tower Berkeley and Leopold?ôs Records. Both were over five times as large as us - how could we compete? But we believed. And we begged and borrowed and put up everything we had in the world, all in, to make this work.The night before we were to open, the Berkeley Inn across the street from us caught fire. We spent that night up on our roof with garden hoses putting out ember after ember wafting over from the fire. We were there that night until 4am, then went home to catch a few hours sleep before our Grand Opening.When we arrived back the next morning, wiped out and bleary-eyed, we saw something we never expected. We saw something that to this day still gives us chills. We saw you. We saw our people.There you were in a line around the block waiting to get in. And our hearts sang. What a truly glorious day that was.The support we felt that first day has never wavered and has enabled us to open two more Amoebas.SF Amoeba in 1997 and Hollywood Amoeba in 2001. We can never thank you all enough for the love Berkeley, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have given us all these years.And, over time, Amoeba has become more than we ever could have imagined. We have helped millions of people from California and beyond find music that means something to them, and that means everything to us.Our all-star staff came from all corners of the country to make us one of the greatest resources and music communities anywhere: a place where true believers can be themselves and where music is the single most important thing.Amoeba has provided free live music to the community for decades with thousands of in-stores by renowned artists such as Elvis Costello, Patti Smith, Brian Wilson, and even the great Sir Paul McCartney.And we have helped break up-and-coming artists at the time such as the White Stripes, the Black Keys, Anderson .Paak, Gary Clark Jr. and so many others.Those other stores are all gone now. But we remain. Still providing and protecting the physical manifestation of our musical heritage.We have become an integral part of each of our communities as well as the larger Amoeba community through our commitment to helping. Through your support we have been able to contribute to thousands of charitable causes over the years.? Including raising over $600,000 for Hurricane Katrina rebuilding; and working with the Rainforest Action Network to preserve and protect many millions of acres of Rainforest. It has been a part of our culture from day one that we are committed to giving back and sharing the support we receive.We have weathered many storms-911, recessions, the Internet, downloading and streaming. But we don?ôt know that we can weather the COVID-19 storm.All three of our stores have been closed since mid-March and must remain closed indefinitely. With no way to generate income, our savings are running out, with bills and rent coming due, and with a primary commitment to our staff, who we are trying to keep as healthy and financially sound as possible.We?ôd like to reassure you that we?ôre doing everything we can to keep Amoeba going, and to position ourselves to play a vital role in what is for now a very uncertain future.We know how much we?ôre all going to need Amoeba again, this oasis of music, where we can find each other once more.We?ôre exploring every possible means of support, including federal and local grants and loans. But these funds are not guaranteed to come in, and they won?ôt meet the needs of our short-term future.So, we most humbly ask for your help. We know that this is a very difficult and uncertain time for everyone, and we understand that there are many individuals and organizations in need.If you are in a position to help us, we would be incredibly grateful to receive that support.Any donation to this campaign will contribute to the cash resources we need to deal with the immediate future, to take care of our staff of over 300 Amoebites, and to allow Amoeba to continue operations.Your donations will also greatly help us finance Amoeba?ôs upcoming move to our new location in Hollywood this fall.And, if you could let others know about this campaign, that would be very much appreciated, as well.Without the physical manifestation of music, we are one electromagnetic storm away from having our culture wiped out. We will not let that happen. We are the keepers of that flame; as are you.Though, we?ôre dark now, Amoeba is still there, waiting for the day when our doors can be opened again to welcome everyone back inside to celebrate the joy of what moves our souls the most: Music.Until then, keep the faith.Listen to Louie and Billie (Holiday or Eilish), Miles and Coltrane, Thundercat and Bootsy, Sabbath and Zeppelin, the Stones and the Beatles, Hank and Patsy, Kanye and Cardi, Otis, Prince, Gram, Django, Amy, Tyler, Sun Ra, John Prine... whoever else moves you.And know we miss you all so much, and long for the day we can all gather again.Thanks, as always, for all your support.?Dave and Marc?P.S.Again, we know these are such hard times for everyone. It is a reversal for us to ask for assistance rather than give it, but these are challenging times, and we truly need your help.We do so with deep respect and gratitude to all of our customers.Thank you.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Readers, non-readers, paying customers or passersby, Hicklebee?ôs welcomed all.Eventually, two partners would leave, another would join in, and for the last 30 years, we would remain: a sister team who set out to make the name Hicklebee?ôs synonymous with quality, community and a commitment to literacy for all.Over 41 years Hicklebee?ôs has continued to operate through recessions, the Loma Prieta earthquake, the advent of Big Box stores and the aggressive business practices of a certain online retailer (ahem).?Still, we persisted.? ? ? ?In March when schools closed and non-essential businesses were shuttered, we made the case that books are essential and partnered with the Santa Clara County Office of Education to create the Keep Kids Reading Book Drive- a campaign to put books into the hands of students during the Covid-19 crisis. To date, the program has delivered bags of books to nearly 400 families in need. Which brings us to this campaign.Hicklebee's has stayed open in a limited capacity during this pandemic, and while we have been working hard taking orders, shipping books and offering curbside delivery, the loss of foot traffic, community events and school business has been financially devastating. The money raised from this campaign will cover those losses as well as operating costs, including payroll, through August. It will also give us time to prepare for the return of school, for our doors to open, and to welcome our community back home.We believe that Hicklebee?ôs is as essential to its community as the gift of reading it offers you.We are grateful to our community and look forward to recommending your favorite books for years to come.?Be well, and stay safe.Monica Holmes and Valerie LewisA few highlights from our history in Willow Glen and in the bookselling community over the past 41+ years:? ?- As new members of the Willow Glen Merchants Association, we joined the movement to plant trees along Lincoln ?Avenue, laying the groundwork for a revitalized Willow Glen and planting the seeds- literally- for the thriving Avenue that exists there today.?? ?- We were key organizers of the first Willow Glen farmers market.?? ?- We have hosted major public events throughout the years, that feature local and international authors and dignitaries for our entire community.? ? ?? ?- Hicklebee?ôs has worked with publishers, authors and national media to encourage literacy as well as diversity in children?ôs books.?? ?- We have appeared on television, radio, in periodicals and published books to promote literacy.? ?- Hicklebee?ôs has received coveted local and national awards including The Small ? Business of the Year Award 2009 presented by Senator Joseph Simitian and The Pannell Award from the Women?ôs National Book Association in 2019 and 2004. The Pannell jury wrote: ? ?úThe winner in the Children?ôs Specialty Bookstore category, Hicklebee?ôs Bookstore in San Jose, Calif., is celebrating its 40th anniversary this month. It is the gold standard for children?ôs bookselling and an extraordinary place that outdoes itself every year.""Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's owner, Craig Smith, likes it to be a community space, connecting people in the small town of Kingston, Washington.? The Firehouse is hosting an Oscar?ôs gala on Sunday, February 9, where they roll out the red carpet and patrons come dressed in their finest.??In this digital age, it is easy to find loads of entertainment options within the comfort of your own home.? But with all this convenience, we can sometimes feel isolated and detached from others in our community. People need contact with each other, even if it?ôs sitting quietly and enjoying a movie together.??This is what makes this community movie theater different.? Before each showing, a movie-buff staffer (usually Craig) engages the audience by telling fun facts and history about the movie, its characters and actors before the showing.? This educational minute not only helps bring the movie to life through further context, but I have also often used this information as casual conversation starters. It?ôs this, and the real butter on popcorn that truly makes the Firehouse special..??In 2008, Craig spent $400,000 to remodel the old Kingston firehouse into what is now the Firehouse Theater, and has gradually been paying back those costs.? The Firehouse monthly movie-goer attendance is roughly the same size as the town of Kingston itself. Even with this high volume of patrons, most of the money from ticket sales go back to the film companies for licensing fees.? Craig?ôs mission before his retirement is to transform the Firehouse Theater to a nonprofit organization that continues to support the Kingston community. This GoFundMe will help fund this transition.Funding PlacementTier 1:? $40,000 total raised ->? Pays off the remaining balance of the theater projectors that were purchased for $146,000.Tier 2: $85,000 total raised ->? Pays off credit card debt accrued for theater expenses and 2nd mortgage taken out to finish the theater (currently at $45,000)Tier 3:? $105,000 total raised -> Upgrades equipment, like theater lighting we always wanted in the main stage to do live theater but ran out money.Tier 4:?? 250,000 +? (just raised it because the response has been so strong and there is so much to do to keep us open long term) Reaching this goal to pay for establishing a nonprofit organization for the Firehouse Theater is another fundraiser so we stop here. Craig will have to retire so selling it or setting up a community board to run things and he can volunteer to help. This will happen within the next couple of years as his wife Becky said so. Want to take over a very cool small town theater???We appreciate any donation amount you can provide.? You can also help by spreading the word about this cause.?

515,Keep Cafe Borrone Alive!,"Created April 21, 2020",Business & Entrepreneurs,"$300,000 ","$162,660 ",1.2K,4.1K,1.2K,"A Message from Marina Borrone, Owner and CEO of Cafe Borrone:My parents, Rose and Roy Borrone, opened Cafe Borrone in 1979. I was eight-years-old, and I remember being in the original building in Redwood City with them daily, watching them and their team work, and helping out wherever I could. They found great joy in offering the community a place to gather and be in communion, a friendly place with the freshest, highest quality food. My parents began from scratch every day to prepare their menu, and made the freshest coffee around (as well as creating the iconic Frosted Mocha!) and also, to welcome each and every person who came through their door. In 1989, we moved our Cafe to Menlo Park and life as we know it today began.The community of folks who relied on Cafe Borrone as not only a favorite place to eat but a treasured place to be grew exponentially. In the past decades, thousands of people have met by our iconic fountain for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner, seven days a week, to be in simple communion with one another, to celebrate life?ôs milestones, and to make Silicon Valley business deals. Multiple generations of local folks rely on Cafe Borrone as a meeting and eating place. The Cafe has become a treasured gem of Menlo Park, shining from sun up to past sun down, always with family friendly service and extreme dedication to providing the freshest most natural food by choosing raw ingredients carefully, supporting local farms, selecting sustainable fish, and searching for the best organic meats around. We fuel a whole host of small local providers with our demand. The Cafe also supports the local workforce and economy by employing approximately 70 employees, many of whom have been with us in the kitchen and who rely heavily on this work for survival, for more than a decade. These employees are not like family to us. They are family.Fast forward to 2020, and a life milestone we are experiencing at the Cafe, and everywhere that is not a happy one--a reason for generations to gather together emotionally but not physically: the coronavirus crisis. At Cafe Borrone we felt the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis and economic slowdown in early February, and I scrambled daily to try to rework the business to accommodate it. By early March the fear of losing Cafe Borrone was already real, but we did not want to close. We wanted to be in community and to continue to support our workers and providers. However, the Cafe is known for its long lines and shoulder-to-shoulder atmosphere, and as the Shelter in Place order became a reality, we knew we needed to shut down on March 15 to help protect our entire community.?I have had the good fortune to be in and around the Cafe (with a short absence for college), for 40 years. As a family we?ôve weathered plenty of setbacks, but this one is unprecedented. With no way to generate income for an extended period of time, our cash reserve has dwindled to next to nothing. I am doing everything in my power to generate funds and get assistance, but as you?ôve likely seen has happened to many independent restaurants on the news, we did not receive any assistance from the PPP loan, and other avenues we are pursuing for loans have also not materialized. The scariest thing about all of this is that we are closed indefinitely. I am working to bring take away service to the Cafe in the next few weeks, but we need to be sure our workers are safe. Financially, we have a large staff we want to support, and we need cash to be able to start the ordering for take away. I am also aware that take away income is a tiny fraction of what we need to survive. It is expected that 75% of independent restaurants will not survive this crisis. I am doing everything in my power to save Cafe Borrone and continue to play our vital role in the Menlo Park and larger community. I am humbled to say that I need your help. I know this is a hard time for everyone. Anything helps - including leaving a comment about your experience at Cafe Borrone, and sharing this campaign whether or not you can contribute.Thank you all so much. I truly hope to see you all at Cafe Borrone again, and SOON!Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the last 4 years, it has also focused on providing low-interest loans and business coaching to street vendors and other small business owners who can't access capital from traditional institutions.?When the COVID-19 pandemic began impacting our communities, we quickly saw that all the data about income inequality was right: most people don?ôt have any savings to cover their household expenses in an emergency. Many small businesses operate with only enough cash on hand to last them 27 days. We heard this loud and clear from the street vendors we?ôve worked with for over a decade. Street vendors who participate in our micro-loan program and those that are involved in the LA Street Vendor Campaign saw their business revenue dissolve almost over night.

As one of the very few Black restaurant owners in the Coulee Regional area in Wisconsin, I focus my food and efforts on community revitalization through storytelling and civic projects. I have decided to set up a GoFundMe campaign for the 40 Acres & a Mule Project in order to collect money to buy agricultural land. This land purchased will be at least 40 acres and Black owned.? The proceeds of this campaign will:¬∑?????? purchase of land to guarantee farm to table resources for the food industry; ¬∑?????? serve to provide an outlet for Black foodways; and, ¬∑?????? establish a safe haven to secure the legacy of Black foodways.? ?Historical context The term ??0 acres and a mule??was derived from Union General William T. Sherman?ôs Special Field Order No 15 , issued on Jan. 16, 1865. The reparations movement, which continues to the current day, cites ??0 acres and a mule??as the U.S. government's promise to make restitution to African Americans for enslavement. The significance of this promise to Black people was to present a conduit not only to be free, but also to own land and be integrated as a part of the fabric of the United States to achieve a more equal footing.? Freedom, land ownership, and the means to prosper were seen as a significant pathway to empowerment by enabling African Americans to be a part of the economy, create businesses, and community. ?Why now?During these troubled times, there is an immediate need to protect and ground ourselves in land that we can call our own. There exists a need to create a legacy for our future generations.? The creation and sustainment of a legacy is one of the most important opportunities I see in the ""40 Acres & a Mule Project"".? It is a great chance to be able to control our narrative and provide educational opportunities to understand our story in food and farming techniques within the hospitality and food industry. My vision is to have a sanctuary to hold the history, food, and stories of Black culture in food and farming.?? This land will be used to teach other how to farm, archive Black food ways and the importance of Black farms.? The 40 acres of land will tell the story of how Blacks grew food through our ancestral ways into today. Where will the campaign proceeds go?Any contributions made to the ""40 Acres & a Mule Project"" beyond the needed funds to purchase the land, taxes, and tools for the farm will be made available to Black organizations that concentrate on preserving Black foodways and support Black farmers in purchasing their own land, buy the land they lease, and/or provide assistance to Black farmers for their mortgage payments.Follow my Instagram? dedicated to this projectRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the years, ?we have proudly created jobs, brought the world's best authors to Ann Arbor, paid our fair share of taxes, supported small and independent publishers and voices, given back to nonprofits and schools, and built a community. But now we are faced with a perilous situation: Due to Covid-19 and the fact that we are closed to the public, we are running out of cash to pay our rent, utilities, payroll, liabilities and publishers, and make sure we have enough cash on-hand to re-open once we make it through.?We are asking for your immediate support. Hilary and I have some emergency life savings and will use it to make sure this store keeps going, but the road ahead looks bleak and uncertain, and unless there are major changes both locally and nationwide, it will not be enough. The loans I've seen currently proposed by state and federal governments is not an option for us, as it simply does not make financial sense for us to take out a loan without any indication we can re-open soon or generate meaningful income to pay them off. So, like so many small business owners who are facing similar situations, we are using this fundraising campaign as an additional effort to support the store.?Funds given to this campaign will help us weather this storm and make sure we can ultimately reach our goal, which is to keep this business afloat and exist in downtown Ann Arbor for another seven years. Even once this passes, we are unsure what the market will look like when we can re-open, what the book buying abilities of our community will be, and how we can quickly ramp up our operations once again. This campaign will help support Literati both in the immediate and over the next several months, and longer.If you can give any amount, we are truly grateful. If not, there are other ways to support us and other small bookstores facing perilous situations, such as signing up for newsletters and social media accounts, buying gift cards, ordering books online from their websites, and lending a kind word.?Thank you for these past seven years. Thank you for allowing us to be part of your lives. When Hilary and I first opened this store, we imagined a lively bookstore, a store where our community could come together and celebrate books. And, despite it all, we have faith that this dream will come true once again.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
523,Save Ken Sanders Rare Books!,"Created July 24, 2020",Business & Entrepreneurs,"$250,000 ","$127,893 ",2.3K,6.5K,2.3K,"Save Ken Sanders Rare Books!Welcome to the GoFundMe site in support of Ken Sanders Rare Books. This counter culture institution opened its doors in Salt Lake City 24 years ago. Beginning with no money, few books, and a teenaged daughter, KSRB has grown into an overflowing powerhouse of an antiquarian bookstore known throughout the Intermountain West, and the world. It?ôs as much a book shop as it is a museum. It?ôs a place where Ken?ôs generosity allows the muse to dwell. For those not in Utah, many of you may have seen Ken Sanders on television from his fourteen years as a rare books and manuscripts appraiser on the popular PBS show, Antiques Roadshow. Ken?ôs bookshop?is an integral part of the very fabric of Utah?ôs culture. His store is under very real threats, most immediately with the loss of sales due to the Covid-19 crisis that has the store running at approximately 50% of normal sales. We know we are not alone in this, but the pandemic shows no sign of going away any time soon. Please do help by donating to this fundraising campaign, we can?ôt afford to lose this cultural icon! KSRB is a place that its community has depended on for many years to provide vital resources by way of literature, poetry, music, art, specializing in Utah, Mormon, Native American, and Western history. It carries new, used, and rare books, paper ephemera, photographs, maps, rock and roll posters, letterhead broadsides, t-shirts, and things you never dreamed existed. The store champions natural history and environment, climate change, social justice, sustainability, radical politics, to name a few subjects near and dear to our hearts. Alternative voices, minorities, women, LGBTQ+, everyone is included. In addition to curating collections, appraising books and manuscripts, Ken has contributed to the book publishing world through Dream Garden Press, founded in 1980, to publish regional poets and authors. The store has hosted thousands of events that include concerts by musicians, poetry readings, book release celebrations, and film showings. To name only a few: Edward Abbey, Charles Bowden, Terry Tempest Williams, Wendell Berry, Tom Russell, Rosalie Sorrells, Utah Phillips, and Alex Caldiero?ôs dazzling performances of Allen Ginsberg?ôs Howl. Ken specializes in oral story telling, occasional writing, and has been featured in dozens of films and documentaries on notable subjects such as Edward Abbey, Tim DeChristopher, Everett Ruess, Ken Sleight, and Earth First! We?ôre hoping this GoFundMe campaign will carry the store operations through this worst of times. Funds will be used for employee payroll, employee health insurance, rents, basic store operations, and supplies needed to reduce the risks of Covid-19 to ensure the welfare of the staff and customers. We are deeply grateful to our loyal fans and customers and appreciate both the love and the financial support you have sent our way. ?We encourage you to visit the store?ôs website?to learn more about the store?ôs inventory and activities.Rare Books Need Rare Humans!There are a few reasons why you might contribute to help save Ken Sanders Rare Books which has become endangered due to the Covid-19 epidemic. You might contribute because you know or have met Ken Sanders personally. Maybe you know him as the gentle soul he is - whose dedication to books, art, nature, history and boundless curiosity have proven a priceless, positive contribution to the business of book selling and also to the world.You might contribute because you have a connection to Utah, Salt Lake City, the West and you appreciate the fact that Ken Sanders Rare Books is a portal unlike many other that still exist. Maybe you understand these bookstores and the people that run them are being pulverized between technology and Covid-19 and that being able to spend an afternoon physically rambling through musty stacks is an experience that needs to be preserved.Maybe you?ôve seen Ken on Antiques Roadshow and get a kick out the fact that he could expound with deep understanding exactly why and how the 1930 Rockwell Kent illustrated edition of Moby Dick can possibly be worth so much money.Or maybe you?ôre just a reader and book lover and want to kick in.In any of these cases your contribution will be appreciated and put to good work. Thanks for being a part of saving Ken Sanders Rare Books!??WRITTEN TESTIMONIALS??In a forest, under the ground, there are networks of fungus fibers that connect the roots of trees together, allowing the trees to share information and resources. They're called mycorrhizal networks and they help keep the whole forest healthy. Ken Sanders Rare Books is like one of these underground networks. You walk into his store and you feel connected to healthy forest. Ken is the gnome who guards it.?The Amazon Corporation is named after a forest but it has no underground, no roots or fungus.?It?ôs more like a virus that kills trees. If Ken?ôs store closes, the forest dies. Simple as that, and tragic as the loss of a species. So I will work to help the store stay open.?Scott Carrier, Journalist__________________________________________________________________________________________I think of Ken Sanders, as do most who know him, as worthy ofState Treasure status standing as he does at Utah cultural crossroadswhere desert rats, intellectuals, misfits, artists, writers, book worms,poets, philosophers come to weave tales with Ken and discover a newauthor, or a new trail of thinking.?The bookshop is where we take visitors when we hope to answer the question:""Why Utah?"" posed by relatives and meaningful friends. They don't knowthat in our minds Ken is a sort of right of passage. If they gasp in wonder atKSRB-- they understand Why-- if they don't -- they never will.?I have been a bookstore nut from the time I found Watkins, Foylesin London - Thorpes in Guildford and Hay on Wye in the 60s.They in their turn defined their time and place and reflected the British character for generations.?The British bookstore, however, is genteel.? A thing of winter, tea and muffins,wooly scarves, cats and damp tweed.? KSRB is more sand in your hiking boots,?thirst, chapstick, rocks in your pockets and brain sort of experience. ??For years now I have been ranting on about the misguided plan for developmenton the site of our Utah Treasure. I can only hope that one outcome of this?dreadful pandemic and inevitable Depression is that developers will not have their way with the land where Ken's Bookshop stands. It is our best mental watering hole.??Jann Haworth, Artist__________________________________________________________________________________________I can easier imagine a cordiality truce between Mormon crickets and seagulls than a closing of Ken Sanders Rare Books.? Name one other place in Salt Lake City where you can go for a thoroughly invigorating browsing and at the same time get a better half hour gym workout than Ken?ôs Place, and simultaneously?îeven though it may be unearned?îbe greeted and treated as an old friend.? KSRB is a SLC institution with an earned reputation for both inventory and eccentricity and our world would be diminished should this bookstore disappear.That said, as we all know, times are genuinely tough and Ken is having an even harder time than usual holding Yeats??archetypal center together.? Now it?ôs time for us to render service and help an old and dear friend out.? I?ôm going to do my part and make a painful sacrifice: give up a minimum of three days??worth of Happy Hour in his honor.? I cannot imagine a Utah world worth living in without Ken?ôs hanging in and being there as a visible icon; can you?David Lee, Apprentice World Class Piddler and Scribbler__________________________________________________________________________________________?I can?ôt recall the first time I met Ken Sanders, book dealer, river runner, cultural icon. But I remember all the moments since.I remember when he commissioned a family river trip with Moki Mak through Desolation Canyon, with fellow bookman Ken Lopez and his family, writer Scott Carrier and two of his young children, and invited me and the Peacocks: Doug, Laurel and Colin. It was my first big river, and 20 years later still ranks as one of my favorite trips.In the early 2000s, he hosted me for a reading at his store when I published my first book, Libby, Montana: Asbestos and the Deadly Silence of an American Corporation, about the death and destruction that the WR Grace Corporation wrought upon a small, working class town in rural Montana. I was a unknown Montana journalist., He had no reason to expect a profit from that event, but knew it was a story that needed to be told.A few years later, Doug needed back surgery and had no one in Salt Lake to take care of him. Ken took him to and from the airport and the hospital, made sure he had a place to recover and fed him all the while. Then, in 2010, Doug?ôs cousin Marc Beaudin and I had this half-baked plan to open a used bookstore in Livingston, Montana. Ken graciously, generously answered our questions from Day 1, and saw us through those first rocky years, providing references for scholarships, guiding us through our first book fairs, and ultimately sponsoring our application to the Antiquarian Bookstore Association of America. There is no better ambassador in America for the next generation of rare book dealers.Ken Sanders is simply irreplaceable.Andrea Peacock, Author, Activist, Bookseller__________________________________________________________________________________________?Few bookstores still exist that satisfy the craving for the smell of old paper, places where you can nose through stacks and magically, the book you need appears, even if it?ôs not the one you came in for. References and histories, rare books on order, entrance busy with every manner of human from the drunk to the erudite, and sometimes drunkenly erudite. If your city is fortunate enough to have one of these, I?ôd do everything I could to keep it.The community of Ken Sanders Rare Books extends past this city to all of the West, part of my life in my little dot of Colorado, and part of so many more authors??lives, an avenue for counterculture and wilderness. Stories have poured through here to packed houses, every aisle and seat filled, a microphone up front, a reader, a singer on guitar, or sometimes only a handful in the audience, each rapt, so glad they came.?Run by Ken Sanders himself, bearded guffawing laureate of literature from the Rockies to the sea, this shop is a cultural necessity. Historians may talk someday of how western society was nudged along by this man, by the tales he promoted and the eclectic range of books he brought to us.?Keep this place alive. Don't give it new digs or put its name up in lights. Keep it as is. The next generation will need it even more.Craig Childs, Performance Author__________________________________________________________________________________________The pulse tells you a lot about the health of a body. A bookstore is the pulse of a city. KSRB has?been telling us a lot about the health of local culture. At this time, the health of the city is not good. This is reflected in the health of our bookstores, and especially KSRB. For the past 24 years (a family-owned shop since 1997), KSRB has held its own. Now it needs a helping hand.This is not just a ?úbook store??I?ôm talking about; not merely a venue for books. There are stores with books in them, and there are ?úbook stores??(stores that sell books, as some stores sell shoes, or fish, or groceries). Then again there is the real McCoy: BOOKSTORE (one word). Today, there are fewer and fewer ?úbookstores?? that is to say, not merely a venue that sells books, but a PLACE where books wait for readers, and create a backdrop for cultural exchanges that promote art, poetry, film, and literary events. Add to these, rare and the collectible objects and artifacts, and you have a BOOKSTORE: KEN SANDERS RARE BOOKS, the real McCoy.On a personal note: my life both as reader and writer, would be a lot poorer if I had never entered this place. The major interactions and contacts with my community of readers and fellow poets/writers/filmmakers/ has been fostered by the physics of this place. This ?úbookstore??and the soul of the place, Ken Sanders himself: flesh and voice and beard ever growing wild.Given all of the above, to say that I endorse KSRB and efforts to save it, is an understatement. Let my voice join the chorus: LONG LIVE KSRB and may we preserve the health of our Salt Lake City.Alex Caldiero,Senior Artist in Residence at UVU and ever, your friendly naybohood sonosopher___________________________________________________________________________________________?Exploring Ken?ôs book store is like going on a weird Safari in a library after an earthquake.??There are books piled high, books tumbling down, books that rattle your very foundation. It is exciting and dangerous and it is one of my favorite places in the whole damn universe.??The universe needs Ken?ôs book store to keep things in balance.??If the store goes the way of the wind it could mean the end of the world!??It is not just an institution, it is a vortex of madness, a depository of all the great ideas that have ever been and an incubator for the brilliance to come.??Hell, Ken even sells my movies!??Trent Harris, FilmmakerRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Truly a family-owned and operated business, Marshall?ôs bookstore is managed by his son Paul with daughter Cassie working as a full time employee.?Since 1973, Walden Pond Books has fundraised for local schools and nonprofits, helped establish other small businesses and local independent bookstores, promoted Bay Area authors, created jobs and nurtured Oakland?ôs Grand Lake neighborhood.

529,Keep JamKazam Alive & Improving,"Created May 7, 2020",Business & Entrepreneurs,"$100,000 ","$107,176 ",2.3K,2.8K,2.3K,"Hello Everyone -?A few years ago, three co-founders created JamKazam and set out on a journey to fundamentally alter what is possible in the world of music performance. Our vision was (and still is) to make it possible for musicians to play live in sync from different locations over the Internet - as if sitting in the same room. Along the way, we added things like the ability to play along with your favorite songs, live broadcast performances, teach/take music lessons, and more.We invested a good chunk of our own money into this vision, and on top of this worked full-time literally for years with no pay to get JamKazam off the ground. We also managed to raise a little bit of money from outside investors, but honestly not nearly enough to achieve our vision. There is so much more we could do to make this service easier to use, significantly reduce latency (lag) in sessions, deliver great new features, and provide better support for our users.?Unfortunately, at this point we have all been forced to take regular full-time jobs to support ourselves and our families, and we are running low on funds just to continue to pay the cash expenses to keep JamKazam running - things like hosting fees, royalties, and all the usual things needed to operate a business like this.We recognize it's a bad time to ask for help, given that millions of people are hurting financially and emotionally right now, but we need assistance to keep JamKazam operational. And we need more help if we are going to do more than keep it alive - to drive it forward to better meet the needs of the worldwide community of musicians.?As we consider our options, we are also taking into account that musicians need JamKazam more than ever, as none of us can meet up in the same place to play together. And this is likely to continue to be the case - at least in phases - for quite some time. We want to help, and this is how we can best do it.If you decide to contribute funds to support JamKazam?ôs mission, we will use these funds to improve the service. A short list of things we?ôd like to be able to do, depending on the level of support from this GoFundMe, include:Reduce Internet LatencyWe?ôve had a solution on the drawing board for years now to reduce Internet latency between musicians significantly. We?ôve conducted experiments that prove we can do this, and recently we?ôve built the technology to do it. But we do not have the capital to deploy this technology. This is at or near the top of our list and is key to making JamKazam work better for more musicians and bands.Guarantee Session ConnectionsMany of you have noticed that sometimes other users are ?úgrayed out??in your sessions, and audio won?ôt stream between musicians when this happens. This issue is caused by the networking approach we use, and this problem would be fixed by the same Internet latency reduction we described in the bullet above. We can make network connections work in 99%+ of sessions. Provide Better SupportRight now we cannot provide any support to our users. We simply do not have the time and are very overwhelmed by the surge in the use of the service. We?ôd like to have someone available to provide support, but we would need to be able to compensate someone for doing this. At the least, we?ôd like to produce more and better help documentation.Fix Bugs & Improve User InterfaceThe user interface on the JamKazam application was never great to begin with, and it has not aged well. The app would benefit from a UI refresh. The whole app would also benefit from a comprehensive testing process that identifies all the bugs that have cropped up over time, and a dedicated effort to fix these bugs to make the application more stable and reliable. Help Musicians to Generate IncomeAnother area where we can help is to improve JamKazam?ôs broadcast features to enable bands to generate income from performances, and to enable music teachers to generate income from higher quality lessons online.What Else?We have plenty of other ideas of great things we can do, and we will also most definitely continue to listen to all of you ??our JamKazammers ??to help guide our path forward. All of your feedback over the years has helped the JamKazam service to become what it is today.Thanks to everyone for taking the time to consider supporting this JamKazam GoFundMe. We believe in the power of music and its importance in people?ôs lives. We hope you'll join us in the work of helping musicians play together and share their art and performances with fans everywhere.Best Regards and Stay Safe,David, Peter, and Seth(the JamKazam co-founders)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------p.s.

We've been here for professional cooks, home cooks, food writers, and anyone else who wanted to be part of that community.(Above: a scene from our annual clean-out event, where we sell old and damaged books cheaply to good homes. 50% of the money raised that way in past years has gone to Edible Schoolyard NYC.)Now,? however, our survival is at risk, and we have to turn to you for help. Our usual sources of income?îeveryday customers, major food conferences, restaurant chefs?îhave all been dealt staggering blows. Without them, we?ôre not coming close to paying our bills.We want to keep Kitchen Arts & Letters open. We want to keep bringing you the important, groundbreaking, and unusual books from home and abroad, and the personal service that tells you we love what we do here.We have a vision for going forward that builds on all we?ôve been to our community through the decades. We??want to become even more useful to food and drink people by? making our website faster, easier to use, and a more complete reflection of our full inventory. We want expand our searches for books you won?ôt find elsewhere. And we will continue to tightly control our costs.?But to be brutally honest, without outside support we?ôll have to close our doors in the near future.A bookstore run for and by people who really care about food and drink booksWhen we opened in 1983, store founder Nach Waxman greeted many people who poked their heads in, among them a man who looked around and declared, ?úIt?ôll never last,??then wished Nach good luck and left.But the store became a destination spot. Nach remembers Julia Child walking in, kicking off her shoes, and sitting down on the floor to inspect the contents of the French section.?We became the place where you can find not only classics like Julia?ôs books, but fascinating passion projects written by authors who self-published because they couldn?ôt interest a big publishing house. The place to find books imported from England, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, Australia, Ecuador, and Argentina.Our basement?îthe marvelous treasure-trove basement, from which Nach extracts countless out-of-print volumes, some to consult, some for sale?îbecame a legend.And every day that we?ôve been open, we?ôve been helping people find the right books for their needs. Not necessarily the most popular or famous books, but the ones that matched someone?ôs skills and ambitions.That?ôs what?ôs made these decades so satisfying. (Above: Visiting authors have included chefs like Massimo Bottura and Ferran Adri?)We?ôre at a crisis pointThe pandemic hit New York City hard. Many of our core customers have been devastated by restaurant closings. In-store traffic stopped for many months and has only weakly revived as people have, rightly, remained cautious.??We?ôve kept hoping there will be some dramatic improvement in our fortunes.?And now our lease has to be renewed. Nach and Matt agreed early on that the one thing we would not do is lay off our staff, two brilliantly talented and helpful part-timers who had already lost the incomes they made working in food service.But otherwise we?ôve cut our costs as deeply as we can while retaining the character that has made us valuable. We can?ôt cut more without ceasing to be Kitchen Arts & Letters.(Above: We're proud to have hosted authors such as Stella Parks and Andrea Nguyen, who brought food!)Please help us stay aliveWe want to remain the place you find the books you were always looking for, the place that has the books you never dreamed existed. We want to delight you with books signed right here in the store by your favorite authors. We want to do for you exactly what a specialist bookstore is supposed to do: connect you to an amazing, ever-growing world of first-rate books.We want you to be able to walk in the door and be immediately distracted by an offbeat new publication. We want you to visit and overhear a pastry chef from Japan talking to a food writer from Pennsylvania. We want to help you find a recipe for the stew that grandpa learned to make growing up in Poland but never wrote down.And we want to continue to send you news of great books, new and old, that deserve attention because of the work of extraordinary authors.So we?ôre asking for whatever help you can give us to survive this crisis, endure in the idiosyncratic style that we?ôve been known for, and evolve to be an even better resource for you. Financial support would be wonderful. So would be sharing the news of our campaign.And if we fail in this effort, please know that we?ôre profoundly grateful for the amazing world we?ôve been part of for all these decades. Food really does bring out the best in people and we?ôve been privileged to see it in our friends and customers.Nach WaxmanFounding PartnerMatt SartwellManaging PartnerRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My ancestors live on through me.I am a farmer, food advocate, chef, writer and photographer. I have been working in agriculture for the last five years, studying organic and sustainable farming practice and documenting the lives of farmers through my writing and photography. In 2019, I visited over 30 farms in five western states, listening to the stories and highlighting the experiences of farmers. With Black farm ownership at only 2% in the United States and with threats to agricultural systems and widespread food insecurity, now is the time to set forth on a dream I have been cultivating for the last decade. I am currently searching for land to start my own farm while writing and researching the challenges facing new and aspiring farmers, especially Black farmers.I have always dreamed of working on my own land. As a Black, queer, woman land ownership has felt evasive for much of my life, not having the capital or the generational wealth to make this possible. I want to build a dream together, founded on regenerative, no till practices and paying homage to the traditional ecology knowledge of my ancestors, and the land?ôs original Indigenous caretakers. I am building seed fund to start a small scale farm, and I need your help. The seed money we raise will contribute to:- the down payment on a 3-10 acre property;- start up costs for farm equipment such as walk behind tractor, seeders, hand tools;- farm infrastructure such as irrigation, wash house and coolers.If possible, I would love to stay on the west coast where I have a large network of farm, restaurant and agricultural community.? We are meeting with brokers and exploring different avenues throughout California, Oregon and Washington. Where ever we build, we will be contributing in monthly land tax and forging partnerships with Indigenous community. 2020 is the year!Why now? In this time of horrific pain and reckoning over systemic racism in this country, it is crucial to not just support Black people in our deaths. You must also support Black joy, uplift Black liberation and invest in Black-led organizations and entrepreneurs. The farm I am building will be a community hub, a place where Queer folx can get their hands in the dirt, where our communities can thrive, laugh, and be fed. We?ôre building this dream together and I can't wait to welcome you all around my future farm table!

536,The 8x10 live music venue COVID relief,"Created October 26, 2020",Business & Entrepreneurs,"$100,000 ","$95,738 ",1.4K,10.2K,1.4K,"Unfortunately, it has come to this. The 8x10 needs your help.For those that don?ôt know about The 8x10, we are a live music venue in Baltimore, Md. Under various owners, the location in Federal Hill neighborhood has been providing a home for live music since 1983. My wife Abigail Janssens and myself, Brian Shupe have owned and operated it since 2005.The 8x10 is legendary for its intimacy, its pristine sound, and most of all, its rabid and fiercely loyal fanbase. We get told all the time by bands that we are their favorite venue east of the Mississippi. We have poured our souls into the venue to live up to those standards and provide a fertile ground for bands and audiences to connect seamlessly.The 8x10 shut its doors on March 13th 2020 and has been dark ever since. Being an entertainment venue, we are going to be the last industry to recover. While bars and restaurants have been open for several months, we just have been permitted to open at 25% capacity.The problem breaks down into two main issues. Safety and Revenue.SAFETY ISSUESThe last thing we are going to do is create a situation where our family of customers, bands, and employees get sick. We have been going back and forth about when would it be safe to open, when the outbreak at The White House happened, that put everything into perspective. How fast it spread, How many people were infected from one little gathering. And that was outdoors. The 8x10 is a small venue. There is hardly any way to socially distance. Even with lower capacity, masks, temperature checks, if someone unknowingly came to a show, The 8x10 would be a super spreader. We couldn?ôt live with that.REVENUE ISSUESRight now we can open at 25% capacity. Do I want to put my staff at risk of bringing home COVID-19 to their children or elderly parents for 25% of their usual tips? Our doorman is going to have to interact with every single patron multiple times a night, what kind of risk is that? But that isn?ôt even the tip of the iceberg. Where are we going to get bands? Bands aren?ôt touring yet out of fear and simply not being able to find enough venues that are allowed to open. Is a band that usually plays to 300 people and makes a couple thousand dollars going to be able to cover the exact same expenses from 25% of their normal ticket sales? And are you the public going to risk coming to shows? What should we do? Should we start charging four times as much for the tickets to make up the difference? We just can?ôt stomach charging $60 to our faithful patrons for the same show they normally pay $15 to attend. There are no easy answers.COST OF DOING BUSINESSMeanwhile, we are still paying our expenses to the tune of $15,000 a month. Our rent alone is $10k a month. Every month. Our landlord has been very generous to offer us some relief and has promised us he will do everything he can to ensure The 8x10 survives this, but he is struggling too. The 8x10 is all about doing the right thing, and we can?ôt run out on our commitment to him or any of our other vendors and monthly responsibilities. Rent, Gas & Electric, Insurance, Telephone, Internet, yada yada yada.We were lucky. We got an emergency relief loan through the government and we have been able to meet our responsibilities up to now. And we can still make it but probably only to the end of the year. But this is a loan, not a grant. It is not a forgivable package, but a loan. That means after working so hard and struggling to serve the community for 15 years, once we had finally pulled our head above water, COVID-19 struck and derailed our retirement plans and now were are once again in debt. The $150,000 dollars that has been keeping The 8x10 from bankruptcy is going to have to be repaid and it is going to come out of Abigail?ôs and my pocket. It?ôs the cost of doing business and we know it. But the government is not helping our industry. Live music venues, movie theaters, theaters for plays and musicals are all suffering the most and going to be the last industry to recover. Since there is no second round of loans or aid on the horizon, it has come to this. We have to turn to the people that come to, and play at The 8x10 for help.We hate the fact that we are asking for charity, but if comes down to begging or letting The 8x10 disappear due to some pandemic?¶We have no pride. We will do whatever it takes to keep The 8x10 alive for our community of music lovers. There is no shame in that. If there was another way, believe me we would be doing it.OUR GOALHonestly, we know 2020 has been a screw job on everybody and finances are tough for everyone. We are just hoping that Many Hands Make Light Work. There have been hundreds of thousands of people that have come through the doors of The 8x10. If we can spread the financial burden of keeping The 8x10 solvent over all the people who have come and had their minds blown by the magic coming off the stage, celebrated with their friends a marriage, birth, promotion, birthday, or just that it is a Friday night. If we can spread it out over the thousands of bands that have played there over the years and told us how much they love The 8x10. If everyone who has ever been touched by what The 8x10 does can just donate what they can afford then the burden won?ôt seem so heavy.Our bare minimum goal would be to put six more months of expenses into savings. Maybe just maybe by then we will have a vaccine or some semblance of our normal lives back. But in March we were sure it would be over by June. In August we were saying it has to be better by October, yet nothing has changed.Whatever we can raise we will be grateful for. I can tell you that every cent of the money will go to expenses at The 8x10 first and foremost. If by some miracle we are able to open soon, 100% of the remainder of the money will go to paying back the $150k loan.? We need your help. We need you to spread this website to every person you know. Do you have a contact with any of the big bands that played The 8x10 back when they were coming up? Send them a link, ask them to give back if they can. Do you have a contact with a music magazine or online community? Represent for us and tell them what we stand for and ask if they can throw us a few.Please, please know that we are only asking for you to give an amount that makes sense for your situation. Every donation will add up, so please don?ôt try and be a hero and end up putting strain on your situation.This is such a horrible situation. We have put 15 years of our blood, sweat, tears, and love into The 8x10. And you have put the same effort into coming and supporting us by seeing show after show. None of us want The 8x10 to go under.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gothenburg, Sweden?ôs ?úmetal capital?? finally had a real, genuine, heavy metal bar that lived up to the city?ôs metal legacy. A bar and live venue by metalheadsfor metalheads (and for anyone else with curiosity and an open mind). The reputation of The Abyss quickly spread; first in Sweden, then Europe and beyond throughout the rest of the world. Praised both nationally and internationally for its authenticity and heart, unique atmosphere and its truly dedicated staff. It has not been smooth sailing all the way though; like all new businesses the baby steps were a bit rough. A successful fundraiser festival not only showed the love and support that both bands and fans had for The Abyss and it was the start of the now legendary The Abyss Festival. The majority of profits from the bar went straight back into the bar and into the second (and third) edition of the festival. In November of 2018 Maya and her crew were forced to buy the place to stay alive. Massive debts due to necessary loans followed. Still things were slowly looking brighter and music loving rockers from all over rejoiced over the fact that it seemed like The Abyss were here to stay. 2020: Present day. The Covid-19 pandemic has not only taken lives, created paranoia and panic, it has also devastated the bar and music venue scene all around the world. The Abyss is also critically affected by it and is now on the very brink of extinction. Lots of customers (even healthy young ones) have stayed away in self-quarantine and the income has plummeted. Currently they earn in one whole week what they normally made in in one busy Friday or Saturday night before the outbreak. The government of Sweden has been hinting at issuing some financial aid for small businesses but it will be too little too late at this rate. This situation is especially disastrous since The Abyss pays invoices retroactively; invoices from before the pandemic outbreak has to be paid with the next to no earnings they get now. The Future: The Abyss??dire situation is unfortunately not unique in these trying times...but The Abyss??existence in itself is unique, and together we can help to keep it that way. So if you feel heavyhearted by the thought of Gothenburg without The Abyss, if you?ôve ever visited a great show there, if you?ôve ever had a really good time there or if you want to visit in the future but haven?ôt had the chance yet; please lend them a hand.

With many of our staff at risk for COVID-19, we have been working with a tirelessly dedicated skeleton crew to continue to provide a literary lifeline to Kansas City and beyond. Taunda, Peggy and Cate have helped us process the orders flowing into our store through our web site and phone. Our son Geoffrey is working remotely to help move your orders through our supply chain. Our granddaughter Madeline delivered us treats to keep the crew happy. Our granddaughters Faith and Ashle helped with Social Media. Our grandson Aidan volunteered to start limited deliveries for us, to speed up our efforts. Our daughter Alison and our granddaughter Halle get a special acknowledgment for working on the front lines across the street at KU Cancer Center. It is a family effort, we believe in our community.The number of messages of support from you are inspiring and deeply heartfelt. We have been so busy answering the phones and packaging books that we have barely had time to respond to even a fraction of your messages, but please know that we hear you. Many, many of you have asked if there is some other way to help.This week?ôs message to you is one of hope and determination.We have been working seven days a week to keep the flow of books moving. These have been very long days, but we recognize that our community needs to keep reading, keep talking, stay together in mind, body, and spirit. We will get through this, even though difficult months lie ahead.Rainy Day Books is known all over the world for our ?úgold standard??author events. Thousands of author guests have brought their stories to Kansas City. In just the last ten years, over 500,000 of you have attended one of our author events. We are in discussions each week about future events for fall (so many big names now!), but we know that social distancing and time constraints will not permit us to restart our live event schedule until early September. This represents a six month shortfall in revenue for our business. In addition, our school and corporate business is a fraction of what it once was.There are also long term trends that the present crisis may impact our operation more than we anticipate. We are unsure about the ability of our community to continue to buy books in the long run. While we are ready to resume full operations as soon as we have permission to do so, the safety and well-being of our staff and customers mandates that we proceed with an abundance of caution. It may take several months before our store returns as the hub of social connection that it has always been.?While we are actively seeking assistance that may be available to small business, our advisors have told us not to completely rely on these programs coming through in time or at the level we would need to sustain our operations.Our landlord is in Bethesda, Maryland. The Fairway Shops are one of many properties that they own across the country, and we anticipate that they are unable to offer us assistance at this time.Today we launch a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe. This campaign is to assist the store with funding short-term gaps in operational expenses and long-term efforts to continue our business, especially our author events series. Our goal is to raise $280,000. Our campaign is based on the worst case scenario provided by our advisors. All funds raised will be used to support our staff, reduce outstanding liabilities, and provide additional help for operational costs. Any support you give is an expression of hope.We miss you all. We miss our family and friends. We miss our community.To our local friends, author friends, media friends, all friends of Rainy Day Books: we are totally committed to our legacy of literacy. We are not as active on social media as many of our bookselling peers because we are active 24/7 with our face-to-face work. Anything you can do to help us spread the word about our operation right now is welcome. We now need you to help us tell our story. Please tell the world that we are working seven days a week to keep the books coming. Please tell the world that every order placed online or by phone matters. Please tell the world that Rainy Day Books wants to and is ready to reopen the door, as soon as it is safe to do so.Today we ask you: If you have ever had a memorable moment at one of our author events, if one of our staff ever recommended a book that changed your life, or if the story of our bookstore ever inspired you to do something special; please help us continue. Even if you are not able to make a financial contribution, you can help us spread this message.We are grateful for each day, and we hope to continue for many more days.We believe in our Legacy of Literacy. We will continue to keep working. On November 4, 2020 we will celebrate 45 years of storytelling, and we hope you will all join us in celebration. Millions of books sold, many more lives transformed.With love and gratitude,Vivien & RogerRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even the CBC agrees.? https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-gun-control-politics-1.5556541As a Veteran, firearms business owner, competition shooter and a believer in democracy, I have been put in a position where I cannot sit back and let things happen passively around me.? It is time to gear up and fight!Over the past 10 days I have had productive discussions with various firearms groups across the country including the CCFR? and the CSSA? as well as the Alberta Government.

The Shooting Edge? along with? Target Sports Canada and some other companies, has decided to initiate a legal challenge on the Trudeau government's sporting rifle gun ban.? Although we hope there are going to be other challenges mounted by other firearms interest groups across the country, we believe that a compelling case needs a compelling victim and no one has been hit harder than individual small business firearm retailers in this country.??Our challenge is NOT a Charter Section 7 Challenge, which is what the CCFR is launching.? We are launching a criminal legal challenge and expect to file in the next few weeks.? We don't want to make any mistakes, so the research MUST be done first.This war must be fought on many fronts.?

The Shooting Edge has already funded the retainer for?our legal team and is willing to forge ahead regardless of financial support from our community, however any help will be gratefully and gladly accepted.?We are launching this campaign to raise funds to be used specifically for this challenge.? We have asked our external Chartered Accountants to oversee this fundraising so that there will be 100% accountability and transparency in our fundraising efforts.Funds will be collected, held, and then only transferred directly to the legal beneficiary.?Our platform is backed by the GoFundMe Guarantee, which means donors are protected by a refund policy. Additional information can be found here.GoFundMe has no platform fee, so 100% of the funds collected after payment processing charges will go directly to its intended recipient.If at the end of this fight, regardless of the outcome, there are funds left over; we pledge to have the donated funds divided EQUALLY between the CCFR , CSSA and the NFA . (and the accounting firm will make sure that happens!)Please also sign this e petition? E 2574? on the House of Commons website asking for the revocation of this draconian OIC.We do not have to agree about Trudeau's firearms ban.?

552,Sustain Community Jail Support in Philly!,"Created July 11, 2020",Business & Entrepreneurs,"$75,000 ","$82,391 ",1K,633,1K,"?úWe, as formerly incarcerated people, deserve the right to take care of our own community. In this moment, we are asking that folks who care about this movement, and who have been energized by the protests and Movement For Black Lives, help us to ensure that this business and service to the community is sustained beyond our present moment. Everyone being released from jail deserves a safe ride to where they need to be, and it is the responsibility of those who are not directly impacted by the racist and violent police and prison system to support and empower those of us who have been doing this work for years so we can continue to do it safely and effectively. This work is life saving to us?înot only for the individuals we?ôre providing help to on State Road, but to all of us who are directly impacted that are able to work together to build a better future for ourselves and our community.??-Goldenrod Drivers Background For much of the past nine years, Brian Watson, a formerly-incarcerated Black man, has spent his days waiting with his van next to the bus stop on State Road in Philadelphia. This bus stop is where people being released from jail are dropped off after being held at any of the four detention centers along this stretch of road. Brian greets each person with understanding, as someone who has experienced incarceration himself. Brian, facing many employment obstacles as a formerly-incarcerated person, has been able to generate a small amount of income providing safe and often free rides home to those being released.? If you?ôve never been to State Road, it is severely disconnected from public transportation. Further, since the pandemic, it has not even been possible to get Lyfts and other ride shares to come to the bus stop. Brian?ôs service is often the only means home for many people who have been released.? Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brian has teamed up with LaTonya Myers from the Philadelphia Community Bail Fund. This partnership allows PCBF to better meet the needs of the community members that they are bailing out and supporting, as well as provides Brian with more stable income for his services a couple days a week.? However, this arrangement has been complicated by recent events. In the wake of George Floyd's death and related protests, the Philly community stepped up to support those being bailed out of jail by offering free rides home from State Road. Though we are grateful for the community's support, this disrupted the work Brian has been doing to care for those coming home and the foundation that he built for his community to be supported by those who are most impacted by the Prison Industrial Complex. When well-meaning efforts are out of touch with pre-existing community-led infrastructure, harm occurs. Brian?ôs work should not only be protected from this harm, it should be further uplifted. Brian and his comrades are a source of care and a beacon of hope for those coming home. As a community, we need to support Brian the same way he has supported those coming home for the last nine years.? To make this happen Brian, Chris Wimberly, and a growing team will need $150,000 to provide full-time jail support, including free rides home, at $30/hr for two years. PCBF and Philadelphia Bail Fund will each pitch in substantial funds towards that goal. This fundraiser is working to raise the remaining amount needed to make this dream possible. Any funds raised over the goal will allow this partnership to continue farther into the future. Brian has now teamed up with Goldenrod Transportation, a company owned and operated by Denise Alexander, a formerly incarcerated Black woman. Denise has provided this endeavor with the administrative support it needs to thrive and grow into the future. This fundraiser is to secure a salary for both Brian and the other formerly incarcerated drivers hired by Goldenrod for this work.? Drivers provide those being released with information about resources, pertinent hotline numbers, a mask, hand sanitizer, and a free ride to wherever they need to go. Our drivers also provide access to their phones so people can call their loved ones. All drivers receive training from LaTonya Myers, the Support Coordinator for the Philadelphia Community Bail Fund. We prioritize trans and gender nonconforming folx, women, and those with medical or mental health issues.? A sweet reunion on State Road! What is jail support, and why is it important?When an incarcerated person is released, they are usually either dropped off at a bus stop or even just sent out from a side or back gate. They may not have money to get home, or a means of transportation. They may be wounded, thirsty, or hungry. They may be disoriented or traumatized. They may not have anywhere to go. They may have been in jail for a day, or in prison for decades. Jail support is a vital, two-part practice: the first part is tracking, which means finding out where people who were arrested were taken, and calling to check in on their bail hearing and arraignment, i.e. when they get charged, and if they?ôll need bail. This aspect of jail support is usually carried out by bail funds, criminal justice advocates and legal collectives. The second part is providing a comforting, well-resourced presence to folks who have just been released, regardless of if they were on a bail fund?ôs list of people to expect. Jail support must be trauma-informed and adaptable to each releasee?ôs emotional state and immediate needs. It can look many ways, but includes: celebrating as folks get released, offering moral support; holding space for the person to feel whatever they are feeling about their ordeal; providing food, water, medical attention if needed, and sanitation supplies and PPE in the COVID-19 era. Once they are comfortable, jail support connects the individual to any necessary legal services, or other needed services such as housing, or in these times, a place to quarantine. Lastly and vitally, effective jail support offers a safe, hassle-free ride to the destination of their choice. Without this support, our community members are left to fend for themselves. Maybe you learned about jail support recently because of the arrests in connection with the Uprisings. Perhaps you have known for a long time about this vital work supporting people as they are released from jail. Regardless, jail support is not just a need that pops up with mass arrests during demonstrations. It is a mutual aid practice with a long history in Black and brown communities. To be done well and respectfully, it must be grounded in community connection. In addition to the services outlined above, jail support means understanding who is missing in the community; finding people inside the jail system; letting families know that their loved ones are accounted for; making sure folks inside know that they are not forgotten and that community is here to support them when they are released; and finally, showing up to keep that promise. Releasees have just come through a traumatizing experience, designed to dehumanize and isolate. Whether they are a protester, someone surviving in street economies, someone in need of mental health support, or someone arrested just for living while Black, everyone deserves to be welcomed out with emotional and physical support and nourishment, a ride home to somewhere safe, and resources to face whatever legal battle lies ahead. In a world that refuses to acknowledge that crime is the result of failing societal structures much more than any individual?ôs actions, all prisoners are political prisoners.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From William Gibson to Katsuhiro Otomo to the crew of The Enterprise, FPNYC was the place to be.? I was fortunate enough to have been hired (after asking all through high school) as a floor salesperson in 1995 and when these responsibilities were passed down to me, it was important to me to carry on these traditions as best I could and pass them on to the current staff.Whenever I think of Forbidden Planet NYC and the role it's had in the careers of some of the biggest writers, artists and other creators, from giving them their first shot in a major marketplace (even if it's just a few copies of their first self-published comic or handmade vinyl figures) to promoting their work when they reach the pinnacle of their fields, I think of this quote I once came across in an old issue of the Comics Journal: ""I avoided Love & Rockets for a long time just because I thought it was just, like, a fanzine. I remember when I finally bought it, after Forbidden Planet had opened, and I remember that they had a huge stack of them for years..."" - former Pratt student Daniel Clowes.Since the beginning of the current crisis, myself and others have worked from home to help maintain the store's business and customer relationships and organize a way to come back from all of this.? The sad truth of the matter is that nothing will be the same for some time, but we need to ensure that FPNYC is in a position to reopen when the time comes.? To do that we are humbly asking for your assistance in keeping FPNYC on its feet.We've gone a month with zero revenue coming in and massive expenses going out.? Rent, utilities, and other bills have added up quickly.? The cost of doing business in New York City is astronomical, especially in a ground floor location off Union Square.? We've recently turned our website back on for mail order, but honestly this will yield just a small portion of what is needed to keep us viable.? Even when we're able to open again we will face enormous challenges amidst the continuing epidemic.? We want all of our staff to have a job waiting for them when the quarantine is lifted, and of course their safety and that of our customers will be of paramount concern.? The money we are hoping to raise will be directly withdrawn by Forbidden Planet NYC to be put towards: - Rent, utilities and maintenance for the period we have not been able to operate under shelter in place regulations- Outstanding invoices that have accrued in that time due to lack of sales revenue- Ensuring every staff member has a job to come back to when New York State allows non-essential retail businesses to reopen- PPE for all staff.? Appropriate safety measures to be put in place to ensure their safety and that of our customers.- A possible reconceptualiztion of the store layout and other operations to stay in compliance with mandated social distancing and other safety measures.- Projected decrease in sales due to probable new occupancy regulations and expected economic downturnWe understand that things are tough and other good causes in this time of need abound, but we ask that you help in any way you can.? Even if it's just by sharing this campaign.For better or worse, NYC has changed since FPNYC first opened its doors.? At one point in the not so distant past you couldn't walk a singe block downtown without coming across an interesting shop, club or gallery space.? Places like See Hear and Kim's Video lined the streets and liberated the minds of people who braved to enter their doors.? You could walk into CBGB or Coney Island High with a fork glued to your forehead and no one would give you a second glance.? They were safe spaces before safe spaces were even a thing.? Unfortunately, so many of these spaces weren't safe from the razing of the city's independent spirit and the raising of New York City rent.? Forbidden Planet NYC has endeavored to keep that spirit alive through it all.? Your background, class, race or religion doesn't matter when two people experience the same form of art, and now more than ever we need the arts to survive and bring people together.? We have fought tooth and nail to continue to be a place where you can be yourself and we want to remain exactly that in a post-pandemic world.We want to continue to see families come in passing the torch, telling us they are buying their kid their first comic, just like my mom did.? We want to continue to see customers go on to be successful writers and artists, who then come back and do signings in the same place they got their break in New York.? We want to be the place where you meet your life partner and provide you with a venue for your wedding photos.? Even if you just need a place to get out of the rain or kill some time before you catch a movie across the street, we wanna be that too.? We want to be there for you when you need a place to escape hard realities like the nightmare we are all going through at this very moment.? We want to continue to influence and contribute to the culture of not only New York City but the entire world.? Art can change a person's life.? It doesn't matter if it's a novel, a comic, a movie or a statue, it all has the same power to inspire.? As people with the responsibility to provide you with the art that achieves just that, we take this job very seriously.? It's not easy for us to ask, but in order to continue to do this we need your help.At the end of the day, we love what we sell and we love sharing this passion with others from around the world.? We want to keep chatting about the culture around it and keep the laughs going with you for as long as we possibly can.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Known best for its ash-e-reshteh and home cooked stews, Taste of Persia owner Saeed Pourkay has cultivated what feels like a home away from home for many members of the Iranian diaspora and a window into Persian home cooking for all others. Saeed is hoping to resume business in a restaurant space all his own in the coming months, but will need to raise $95,000 to get there.?Backstory:?For two decades, Saeed ran a print shop with his three brothers across the street from Pizza Paradise in the Flatiron District. In 2012, he cashed out his share in the business to ?úsearch for his happiness?ù‚Äîfor Saeed, happiness meant pursuing his love for cooking. He started selling his now iconic ash-e-reshteh at the Union Square Holiday Market. In March 2013, he set up Taste of Persia in one of Paradise?ôs small windows. Taste of Persia?ôs traditional home cooked fare has received praise in publications like The New York Times, Insider, and Gothamist as one of New York City?ôs few Persian eateries.Keeping the restaurant open over the past few years has been a challenge, but Saeed has prevailed: He has managed to afford the space?ôs $4,000 monthly rent, and despite being the sole cook and being beholden to the pizzeria?ôs kitchen schedule (which means sometimes clocking in as early as 1:30 a.m to prepare food for the day), he has consistently served some of the best Persian food in the city. On December 12, Pizza Paradise informed him with less than two months notice that the restaurant would like to move in a different direction, and no longer would like to share the space with Saeed starting February 1.??How You Can Help:Saeed does not have the funds saved to rent and build out a restaurant space in the expensive Flatiron District, especially with the short notice he was given as a father supporting his two boys. When Taste of Persia closes on January 31, Saeed will have to pause business and resort to freelance catering, until he raises enough to open his own restaurant?îthat?ôs where you come in.?Saeed?ôs goal is to raise enough in order to open a small counter service restaurant in Manhattan?îthe goal is to continue serving his existing clientele within reasonable proximity to his 18th street location/Flatiron, have enough space to seat 10-15 people and for a small kitchen. In order to open back up as soon as possible, cover three months worth of rent and a deposit, and have funds for renovations, furnishings, kitchen equipment, and insurance lined up, we have collectively set his fundraising goal to $95,000.?We hope to get Saeed?ôs business back up and running, so that he can pursue his love for Persian cooking and continue to feed New York City!Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of our employees who are more behind-the-scenes but incredibly important and loved, like our porters, dishwashers and bussers, are going to be especially hard hit financially. Many of you, members of our beloved community, have been asking how you can help so we have set up this GoFundMe to provide our employees with financial assistance during this difficult time. We don't know yet how long this closure will last but 100% of these funds will be distributed among our staff. We recognize that it's a difficult time for many industries, not just ours, so we truly appreciate any donations, no matter how small.Though these are dark days for us, our resilient family has survived the recession and post-9-11 so we know that we will survive this as well. Thank you for all the love and support.- Marc Forgione & Christopher BlumloRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My machinist career started with naval ship repair as a civilian contractor back in 1975 continuing for 15 years, after which, while helping other smaller job shops grow towards their goal, I broadened my career by learning key trade specialties. In 1994 I created Turn Wright Machine Works, started with the shop location at 60 Lovells lane, Marston?ôs mills, then in 1997, I moved the shop to 791 Main Street West Dennis, where I continued to provide a unique service to the cape and Islands. My years of experience cater to all craftsman of repair, fabrication and manufacture, with specialties like marine propulsion, performed with workmanship expectations that supersede the national boat standards, along with the same workmanship attention to other non-marine related projects which has built trust and friendship by my customers, beyond the services rendered.??I am now, sole owner of Turn Wright Machine Works, by divorce, after 26 years; I feel blessed, because I have a chance to continue on with the physical machines, tooling and branding, that were associated with Turn Wright Machine Works. Because of the divorce, the property is going to be sold and Turn Wright Machine Works physical location is going to have to relocate. I have been offered a prime location in nearby industrial zone over in South Dennis, 159 Great western Road, that will suit a machine shop, however, the condition of premises needs many costly upgrades to properly support turn Wright Machine Works to the standards that I demand.?My new landlord is stepping up to the plate and refurbishing the shell of the building but of course I will have the financial responsibility for all the add-ons needed to set up and operate Turn Wright Machine Works, like plumb in the proper three phase electric power supply, lighting, Painting, climate control, safety requirements along with adding on insurance ECT. This transformation / move is greatly exceeding my conceivable budget especially since my funds have been depleted in the process of divorce. My heartfelt dreams are to have a successful renovation of the new Turn Wright Machine Works. ??Any helping funds will allow me to set up the new location on my own and continue to operate Turn Wright Machine Works supplying its unique needed services here on Cape Cod and the Islands. Equally important and personally dear to me, keep my YouTube channel ?úKeith Fenner??where I get to give back by supplying educational YouTube videos and my support for the machining community which I have been part of since March of 2011. ??I live each day, waking up with motivation to help my customers by using my old school talents while helping them out with their unique projects they bring to me.

576,Rock Band Land Save Our Staff (S.O.S.) Fund,"Created April 22, 2020",Business & Entrepreneurs,"$400,000 ","$65,058 ",212,436,213,"Though us donkeys at Rock Band Land are remaining positive and proactive, the sad and undeniable truth, is that the extended closure of shelter in place, the expected loss of summer revenue (even with creating The RBL Donkey Camp Show? as an online alternative), and the uncertainty of when we might again be able to host our in-person classes and camps, has left Rock Band Land in a dark and cold room without a blanket and just our fingernails to eat. Many of you know that I am prone to hyperbole and exaggeration for comedic sake, please know that I am being dead serious when I say that this crisis is potentially going to financially ruin us, and we are facing the very real potential that Rock Band Land might have to close permanently.We are not giving up, we have applied for every single loan and grant that we qualify for (so far the results have been less than emboldening), we are designing an entirely virtual summer camp option and we are looking ahead to every possible opportunity to keep the business afloat. Since the first day of SIP, Marcus and myself have reduced our pay to 50% and we have been able to keep our staff fully employed and fully paid through our business savings. At the end of April however, everyone will be taking a drastic pay cut, and by the end of May, without a renewed and reliable revenue stream those pay cuts will be made even more severe. Because we know that without our staff RBL would never have become one of SF?ôs? great community arts resources as it has grown to be, we have agreed to sink or swim as a team.?As you know, the RBL staff consists of some seriously phenomenal people (Rebecca, Taylor G., Alejandra, Taylor M., Maira, Kyle, Florie, Jake, Caitlin, Michael, and Marcus and myself). In honor of these fine folks who have done so much great work for your kids and the kids of SF, I?ôm respectfully and humbly asking you to consider making a donation to the RBL Save Our Staff (S.O.S.) Fund so that we can keep everyone employed, even at lower wages, and maintain the castle.?Please know that RBL is an LLC, not a non-profit, so there would be no tax break for donations made to our cause.?Please also know that in the history of RBL we have never borrowed a single penny. We have never had a loan or ran up a credit card. We have zero debt. We started the company with a big idea and just $120 (our first paid enrollment fee) and, with your support, we have built it into the community-minded artistic oasis for all the young creative donkeys of SF to assemble, share, and make great art and music. I can?ôt tell you how much it pains me, and goes against every D.I.Y punk rock bit of my soul, to be asking you, our beloved community, for financial assistance to help us weather this storm. I can tell you that I would slow dance with a hungry crocodile, shave my butt hair, braid it, and wear it daily as a headband, or pretend forevermore that I love cats, if it meant that we could keep from losing the incredible people who work at Rock Band Land as well as to keep from losing the amazing castle that we built for our students.?For some perspective on what we are facing, we maintain a 4500sq ft castle with rents that are almost $13K a month. Our most streamlined payroll runs between $36K - $54K per month (depending on the number of pay periods per given month). If you figure in other essential expenses, utilities, and unexpected expenses (i.e. repairs, necessary purchases, etc?? it easily adds another $5-6K per month, bringing us to $46K - $61K per month in expenses (depending on the month). Simply put, it costs quite a bit just to keep the doors of RBL ?úopen??while we are closed. We are hoping to raise $400K with this campaign as that is roughly the amount it would require, should we lose the majority of our summer camps (our primary source of revenue) and should our fall session of classes be impacted by limitations of the numbers of people who can safely assemble, for us to make it to December 31, 2020. That number would allow us to cover rent and essential expenses as well as maintain our staff, all of whom would be taking a significant pay decrease. Should we be fortunate enough to receive any of the loans that we have applied for, and / or should there be any donations coming in from cancelations to current enrollments, we will of course be adjusting the total of the donation amount that we are asking for.?We have always been responsible with our money, and, even though our profit margins are relatively slim, we?ôve always managed to save with plans towards greater expansion in the near future. With those savings close to exhausted (they will be gone by June), and those future plans now on indefinite hold, after making countless artistic creations with our RBL donkeys, making more videos than the security team at SFO, and writing nearly 500 entirely original stories and songs, and, we now find ourselves singing a most unfortunate cover song, ?úBrother Can You Spare A Dime??ù¬†¬†¬†Where will your money go? All donated funds will go to helping us make rent and pay the staff and cover those essential expenses. Rent takes top priority as we?ôve all agreed that, if need be, we can figure out a way to hustle as individuals for a bit and still remain a team. If we were to lose the castle however, then all is lost and we simply could not afford to restart RBL elsewhere. Should we be able to avoid a crash landing, once this plane has leveled out, any remaining donated funds would go towards a RBL Scholarship Fund directed specifically to kids of families within the vast RBL community whose parents might have lost work due to the crisis and therefore could no longer afford to attend RBL.??I can?ôt express to you how grateful we are for all of you in the Rock Band Land community. Part of our mission is to be a positive support for SF families, so it sure stings a bit to be asking you to support us now financially, especially when we know that many of you need help now too. Any and all donations would be immensely appreciated. If you happen to know any billionaire donors, who are looking for constructive causes and community-minded businesses to support or to loan money to, please send them our way. Or if you know any witches who can make a pile of money without stealing any souls, or know any pirates with treasure that they maybe just found on a beach somewhere and didn?ôt necessarily kill anyone for, then please give them my number as well.?Thank you all.?Sincerely,Brian (& Marcus & The RBL Staff)Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, we have expanded to become the Mount Holyoke College Campus Store, in order to serve the college community.And, as a proud and committed independent bookshop, we have worked hard to provide you with a carefully curated and continually updated selection of books that represents not only the many voices of our diverse country, but also voices from around the globe. My wonderful staff and I have taken great joy over the years in working with you to help you access and engage with a range of books, authors, and activities that we hope have helped to enrich your lives, and the life of the larger community.?And in turn, you--our loyal book-loving community--have supported the Odyssey through two fires, one flood, and several economic downturns. We would not be here without your support, and we are so grateful.But now COVID-19 is putting the Odyssey?ôs future in jeopardy. Since March 17 we have been closed to the public. At this time it wouldn?ôt surprise me if we are closed into the summer. Two large off-site revenue-generating events were cancelled in March, along with several in-store author events. April events have all been cancelled; we assume the same will be true for May.?May is usually our best sales month, particularly because of Mount Holyoke College activities and graduation. But the College is closed. Accepted students for the Fall will not be visiting campus in the Spring, and graduation and two reunion weekends in May have been cancelled. ?So, without a doubt, we face a significant cash flow crisis.?I will apply for the grants outlined in the stimulus package which could help with rent, utilities, and payroll. However, this will not cover all our losses, and we still need to pay publishers, other vendors, and try to continue to support our staff. My husband Jon and I have already put significant money into the Odyssey and will add more from our personal savings. However, I?ôm 68 years old and I can?ôt afford to take on the amount of debt that I believe is necessary. I?ôm not ready to retire--my dad ran the Odyssey until age 79, and I hope to be here at least that long--but a long term loan at this stage is not a viable option.?So, for all these reasons, I come to you, our community, asking for help and whatever financial support you can give us in these times that I know are challenging for all of us. The money raised in this campaign will help the Odyssey weather the storm and ensure that we remain a vibrant part of this community for a long time to come.?All of us at the Odyssey are truly grateful for any amount you can give. Thank you for your loyalty and support. Please stay safe.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

580,Help for Bunch of Grapes,"Created April 19, 2020",Business & Entrepreneurs,"$50,000 ","$63,285 ",575,1.4K,576,"Hi, I?ôm Dawn Braasch. Many of you know me, but many more of you may not. I?ôm the owner of Bunch of Grapes, a bookstore I have treasured for many years - long before I had the opportunity to purchase it in 2008 and even long before I began working here as a part time events coordinator in 2007. It has been an absolute honor to own the bookstore that holds fond memories for generations of book lovers - year-round Vineyarders, summer residents, and visitors alike - and I?ôm proud of the work we do and of the reputation the store has held for a half century thanks to its robust offerings, knowledgeable staff, and outstanding author events. It is therefore difficult to find myself in the position of needing to ask for your help.?I?ôm grateful for the support you?ôve shown every step of the way, through every challenge we?ôve faced - and the challenges have been many. With the help of countless people - authors, customers, publishers, the Vineyard community - we were able to rebuild after the devastating fire of 2008. It required a lot of work and the first of several moves - into the small space on Church Street while we rebuilt, then back into the old building at 44 Main Street which was given new life - new paint, new fixtures, new books. Soon after we reopened, however, our nation?ôs economy tanked. The lure of Amazon and e-books soared, and bookstores suffered. But we adapted. Then, in 2012, we found we were in the position of having to move again. We made a new home across the street at 35 Main Street and reopened Memorial Day weekend. We all - customers included! - adapted to the new space. We loved the open rustic feel, we loved the space, we loved being on one floor. We adjusted to the new landscape, both in the physical sense and in the bookselling world more generally, but we saw sales decline each year. We tweaked, we recalibrated, we brainstormed. We made it work. Then, in 2017, it became clear that we would have to move again. We found our new and current home just up the street at 23 Main Street. The entire staff - some of whom had only been with us a few weeks - worked so hard to pack up the old space, think about and prepare the new space, and reopen a different but charming and welcoming store just in time for summer. We love the big front windows, we love the creaky floors, we love the charming second floor, similar to our original home at 44 Main. And we love all the friends and neighbors who continue to support us in our new home. But still, sales have declined each year. Again, we?ôve tweaked, we?ôve recalibrated, we?ôve thought and thought and worked and worked and positioned ourselves as best we could to adapt to declining sales. And then.?We have been closed to the public for about a month now. While we have every intention of reopening once it?ôs safe to do so, we know that this summer is going to be unlike any that any of us have ever seen. Like many businesses on the island, we rely on a robust summer season to carry us through the rest of the year. It?ôs what allows us to (barely) stay open through the winter and serve the year-round population, and it?ôs what enables us to stock our shelves with a world-class selection of books and to attract the caliber of authors we do for free events. And perhaps unlike bookstores in cities or bustling towns who have a reliable and steady flow of sales throughout the year, we don?ôt feel too hopeful that we?ôll be able to make up lost ground once we?ôre safely on the other side of this. This closure and the road ahead are our biggest challenge yet, and I feel uncertain about how we?ôll weather it. We have shortfalls every year during the slow winter months, and I have been able to bridge the gap when needed. That is no longer possible, this gap is too big, and so I am humbly asking you, our book loving community, to help us bridge that gap. Whether you are able to give $5 or $25 or $100 or more, please know that every single dollar is truly appreciated and will help us reopen when the time comes. I am so grateful to live on an island that appreciates the intrinsic value of an independent bookstore, an island that understands what a different community we would be without one. Thank you.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Back then, used bookstores in the neighborhood were the norm. Now, we?ôre the last of the old guard. And we want to go on, but the future is unsure and our ongoing debts are real.During the months we were closed, people knocked on our window every day.? Here?ôs what one of our neighbors wrote:Zadie Smith (Author of White Teeth and Swing Time among others)?úWithout exaggeration, if Mercer Street Books closes you might as well just shut down the village and call it a day. It is a centre of culture, a library's reading room, a record store, a tiny gallery (constructed of art book covers) a late-night hang, an autodidact's paradise, the site of the best overhead conversations to be found beneath fourteenth street, and a great place to find out just how little the reviewer who received your latest proof actually read of said proof (spine unbroken; zero notes made.) Without Mercer what's left? Frozen yoghurt? Vegan cupcakes? To do my particular kind of work, these past ten years, I've needed Mercer's like a body needs food. I can't be the only one. Long may it continue!?ùDuring the shutdown people shouted through the glass that they wished we could reopen, soon. They told us they missed the browsing. They missed losing themselves in new ideas, new worlds, new lives. These people were from every part of our community: longtime customers, writers, students, faculty, travelers, the people next door. Used bookstores are important. There?ôs every reason for us to want to stay in business. But there is the debt?îmonths of it. Thus Mercer Street Books would like to raise $97,500.More of our customers had things to say:Ben Kafka (Critic and author of The Demon of Writing: Powers and Failures of Paperwork)?úI think it?ôs Colson Whitehead who says that you?ôre a true New Yorker when the places that are no longer there feel more real than the ones that are. The old Barnes & Noble on 18th St; 12th Street Books; St Marks Books; that bookstore at 1 University Place; the Strand before they installed air conditioning. We can take this melancholic tour, or one like it, in our minds.?úA lot of us are going to be feeling that way a lot in the months and years ahead. So much has been lost, irrevocably, in such a short time. Let?ôs do what we can to keep Mercer Street Books & Records going. It?ôs both the shop and the idea of the shop that need rescuing ??the New York, and the Greenwich Village, that brought us here, or kept us here, and that keep us going.?ùChristopher Bram (Author of Surprising Myself and Father of Frankenstein which became the Academy Award winning film Gods and Monsters)?úMercer Street Books & Records is one of the gems of New York, a great shop full of surprises, a time machine that looks back to a past when the city was full of unpredictable stores for real readers. Let's keep this one going into the future. New York City would be a less soulful place without it.?ùValerie Steele (Curator of the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology)?úMercer Street Books is a gem - one of the unique stores that makes New York City the cultural center that it is. I feel happy every time I come in - and even happier when I come out, always with some terrific books.?ùJeremiah Moss (Author and Blogger of Vanishing New York)?úMercer Street Books is a haven, a consummate ""third space"" where people gather in informal community to discuss politics, the news of the day, and the ideas they're discovering in the books they read. Walking into Mercer Street Books is like walking into a social club that is open to anyone who comes through the door. To lose it would be to lose another piece of New York's rebellious soul.?ùThat is what the people around us are saying about Mercer Street Books & Records.Dare we say that a bookstore is like an ancient temple to ideas? We think so, and hope you think so as well. But the temple must stand. That's why we are asking for your support right now. We all hope the books and the ideas will continue to flow for years from Mercer Street Books.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The heart of the business is the well-being of all animals. It's about helping people take the best possible care of their animals. The Pet Place offers a full-line of high quality supplies, exceptional customer service, special and custom orders, referrals and information, problem-solving, nutritional counseling, and much more. For the past 28 years, we have assisted in finding homes for thousands of animals, reunited pets, hosted weekly adoption fairs, petitioned for numerous advocacy issues, have raised funds and awareness for local/state/world-wide disaster relief, and have made donations to many different organizations. We also support individuals who care daily for homeless animals, which includes rescue, feeding, spay/neuter, and finding forever homes.? ? The city of Menlo Park named us business of the year, giving us the prestigious Golden Acorn Award for professional excellence and community service. We were the recipient of Pet Product News Magazine's U.S. Retailer of the year award for community service and also were voted favorite pet supply in 34 newspaper polls.? ? In the past few years, the internet has severely impacted our business. Maintaining competitive prices, increasing costs, and high rent have also caused financial hardship. Since we are not a corporation or funded by venture capitalists... just a husband/wife team, local and independent... we have had to use our savings to survive, all with the hope things would turn around.?? ? We find ourselves in a difficult and humbling position. We have always been there to help others, now we need help. In early March, before the pandemic, we had set a retirement date for June 30th, and signed the lease extension. Then, a short time after that the virus shutdown hit. It is absolutely crushing us. Even though we were able to stay open as an essential business, there has been a huge loss of income... paying full rent ($16,000/month) for those months, employee wages, regular overhead and maintenance, etc., while struggling with the lowest sales in our history.? ? The pandemic is making the store closure a logistical and financial nightmare. We are very worried because we were counting on liquidation to replenish our depleted savings, to pay bills, and to cover closing costs. There is also the concern about even being able to sell inventory, fixtures, slatwall, equipment, etc. at this time. Also, the close-out sale will be adversely affected by the social distancing restrictions.? ? We are at an impasse... we cannot afford to stay in business, and at the same time, The Pet Place has been our life and our passion. On the other hand, we have worked 28 years, six, sometimes seven, days a week without a vacation. We have given as much as we can for as long as we can... we are worn out. It is time.? ? We have made so many friends, seen families grow-up, and have shared laughter and tears. We have a love affair with our customers, two and four legged and we will treasure the time we had together and all the wonderful memories.?? ? We have always taken great pride in helping our customers. It has been an honor to serve the community. We feel very fortunate to have this profound connection. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support.? ? Hug and play with your animals as much as possible.

Honestly, when we realized this, we considered closing the school. But staff and students alike asked us to do what we can to stay open.We set our fundraising goal based on our enrollment constraints, our ongoing expenses, and our obligation to our dedicated instructors.?We are still working long hours to keep The Art Academy alive and keep the students and staff engaged.?We are very thankful to all of you who visit this site and consider helping us out.Please consider sharing ?this post with others.100% of the proceeds of this fundraiser are going to staff salaries and business expenses.? Thank you!https://youtu.be/hu6CG3ZBg_Mhttps://youtu.be/-VvNahNFGGUhttps://youtu.be/3nC4dGVQpgoA special thank you to Robyn Ehrlich for making these videos.ZACK?ôS STORYThe Art Academy is a Twin Cities small business that has been providing high quality art education to children, teens, and adults for over 27 years. My Dad, James Robinson, founded the school in an effort to provide a style of art education he felt was disappearing in modern programs.During his childhood my Dad showed a huge interest in art but was unable to find quality education. He spent much of his life looking for good teachers and had difficulty locating a place where he could learn traditional drawing and painting techniques. Eventually, he decided to provide the education that he struggled to acquire. Combining his passion for art and his great ability to connect with young students, he opened The Art Academy in 1993.?The principles of art taught at his school are rooted in a deep understanding of the history of art and art education. My Dad, his partner Sarah Howard, and all of the teachers at The Art Academy continually emphasize that art is a skill and not a talent, that practice makes perfect, and that anyone, regardless of their background and experience, can do exceptional work.My Dad and Sarah and their dog Paavo. Paavo is always in class making kids happy.In order to promote the best possible learning environment for each and every student, The Art Academy focuses on small groups and one-on-one instruction, teaches a wide variety of mediums, and has a diverse structure of lesson plans. This allows everyone to become confident artists in their own areas of interest and accomplish their own creative goals.Unfortunately, this style of instruction is not possible due to the conditions caused by COVID-19. Classes cannot run and the school has no income. Bills are piling up, and relief for small businesses at this time is limited both locally and nation-wide. Dad and Sarah are trying their best to keep the school alive for future students by making huge sacrifices to continue to support their fantastic teachers. They are living off savings and using those savings to keep their twenty-five teachers employed. They need help to make it through this challenging time. 100% of the proceeds of this fundraiser will go to staff salaries, rent, utilities, scholarships, and other recurring business expenses.The loss of community and education provided by The Art Academy would be substantial if the school was forced to shut down. Students and teachers all around the Twin Cities area would lose a valuable place of learning, friendship, and support. In this time of great need and turmoil we hope you can help. Any financial support would be deeply appreciated. To learn more about the school and its amazing students and their work, please read on.This collection of paintings from kids between the ages of 14 to 18 highlights the great achievements of Art Academy students.

The Art Academy has turned into my Dad and Sarah?ôs extended family, and it?ôs my extended family, too. All of the teachers are dear friends. They grew up at The Art Academy and share their love of drawing and painting with those around them.Andrew began taking art classes at The Art Academy when he was 7.

Now she's married with two little girls of her own. Dad and Sarah remain her dear friends.I am lucky to speak from experience when I write about this. At a young age I took lessons at the school and was a teacher there for over 5 years. At The Art Academy I saw students progress beyond what they thought they were capable of doing, which is the greatest joy of teaching. There is no better reward for a teacher than having a student complete a project that they thought was impossible, and this happens all the time at the school. It is also a great gift to see parents so thrilled with how much their kids have grown as artists.That?ôs me, working on a painting when I was 7.?This is my brother, Nate, starting an oil painting when he was little, too.

It?ôs a dream come true when you can bring the two together. This has been our mission since we opened our doors 15 years ago.Like a roller coaster ride, it?ôs been sometimes wild, sometimes terrifying, but always glorious. In 2008, we moved the shop to a bigger, more accessible, and more expensive space only to have the economy crash the following month. It was tough. We sacrificed. But with the help of our creative staff and way too many cookies, we survived by becoming much more than ?újust??a bookstore. We sought to become a community space where our Little Shop kids and their grownups could come together to share books, ideas, opinions, hopes, and dreams. We wanted to create a place where everyone would want to bring their families again and again and again.The results included the creation of On the Same Page (our community wide reading initiative), the blossoming of our book-based summer camp program, the expansion of our book fair business along with other forms of school outreach, and the revival of the Decatur Christmas tree. These are only a few examples of how we rallied to bring children and their adults together around books following the recession.? We also expanded our community and school outreach to work with non-profits and other entities to ensure that ALL children had regular access to books and the people creating them.Now, there is a new crisis. We have had to pivot quickly and rethink our model, closing the shop to customers and shifting to online and phone ordering followed by shipping/curbside pickup/home delivery. The outpouring of love and support from our community has been both beautiful and moving. We are so, so very grateful. The phone is ringing off the hook and online sales have increased tenfold. The pace is frantic and exhausting, but we?ôre busy and our entire staff remains employed, receiving their regular paychecks and health care benefits.Yet, it is still not enough to sustain us indefinitely.We have already experienced an unrecoverable loss in revenue due to cancelled spring book fairs, author events and school visits, and birthday parties. Our entire summer camp program is in jeopardy.We are writing to humbly ask you to donate, even the smallest amount, to our Go Fund Me campaign. While we are pursuing both federal and private assistance through loan and grant programs that will help us in the very short term, we still need help to continue to pay our incredibly dedicated and committed staff as well as to cover rent, utilities, and other fixed costs and liabilities. Through our Go Fund Me campaign, we hope to address our long-term viability so that we can continue to grow and evolve along with the readers we love.Several of you have already donated to us through our online ordering site, and we thank each of you so much.We also know that, like us, many of you are feeling financially anxious and unsure. If you cannot donate at this time, we ask you to please consider sharing our campaign through social media or sharing our online ordering and gift card links with family members and friends who share your passion for books, kids, and local business. We also hope that, when you are able, you turn to us for your book needs: gifts, required reading, a way to escape. We are here for you.You?ôve heard the following from us a lot lately: We are so grateful for you, our community, and your belief in our mission. Everyone on our team considers it an honor to serve your children, to be a part of their lives. We will never be able to thank you enough.The idea of owning a bookstore is a romantic one. Diane recently remembered that when first opening the shop, a friend said, ?úYou are so lucky!

We?ôre not the only ones. We see our community struggling: our colleagues in the hospitality and entertainment industry are out of work; members of the music and performing arts communities have lost gigs for the foreseeable future. Knowing all this, it feels difficult reaching out to you.On March 16th, 2020 we made the difficult decision to temporarily close our doors to adhere to government guidelines and do our part to flatten the curve.The problem is, like with most small businesses right now, closing our doors means our income grinds to a halt, while our expenses do not. The big one being our rent.?For most bars and restaurants, margins are razor thin at the best of times. We spent the last of our cash reserves to pay our team of 30+ employees their final paycheques. Now our bank account is empty while our April rent is overdue and May rent is looming.Help us avoid a lockoutWithout legislation that protects commercial tenants from eviction, our landlord?ôs threat to lock us out feels very real. Having seen this already happen to another Winnipeg bar just last week, we are genuinely worried.Although the federal government has announced intentions for commercial rent assistance, with no details available we fear it won?ôt come soon enough, or last long enough (Trudeau announced it?ôs only for the months of April, May and June).?It?ôs going to be awhile before we can do what we do best?îbringing people together through music and community events. September if we?ôre lucky. The live entertainment sector will likely be the last part of the economy to operate at ?únormal levels??again as social distancing measures slowly loosen.With your support, the money we raise will pay 50% of our April, May and June rent with the hopes that the federal plan will cover the other half. Considering our estimated reopening in September, we will use the remaining donations to pay rent over the summer.What we?ôre doing in the meantimeWe are in the process of applying for the Canadian Emergency Business Account loan to go towards our mounting utility bills. We don?ôt want to keep worrying about whether or not we can pay our next bill. Our goal is to focus on helping reignite the Manitoba music and arts community once we can open again.We aren?ôt ready to give up on the Good Will Social Club, and we hope you aren?ôt either.With love and thanks,Anthony, Cam, David, Donavan, Mike, Tim and Tyler?Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After years of divestment, Camden has recently become home to a growing number of small businesses that support our residents' retail, dining, wellness, and entertainment needs. Most of these businesses are owned by people of color and immigrants who work around the clock to live out their dreams and provide critical goods and services to our community. These institutions weave the fabric of the Camden village.While the city grieved the tragic murder of Mr. George Floyd, a negative force invaded Camden and tried to destroy its community-grown wealth. Over the course of three terrifying nights, windows were? shattered, stores were looted, and buildings burned. Years of hard work and entrepreneurship were lost to individuals who came to terrorize our diverse community. The damage is painful, but our hope is profound.It is in this spirit that the Upper Northside Business Association is collecting donations to rebuild the businesses we lost in May of 2020. We are asking for your help to restore our village and make our community whole. All money collected will be directly and proportionately distributed to the impacted business owners.

Through my initiative, Nourish In Black (formerly known as #ChopItUpATL), I orchestrate beautiful, healing, dialogue-based gatherings. Through this platform, I seek to honor storytelling, art, and cultural foodways.I have firsthand experience with food injustice, spending part of my childhood in a food insecure neighborhood in South Florida. In 2013, I launched an art and retail business that evolved to include a food justice based event initiative, Nourish In Black. This initiative highlights Atlanta?ôs food justice organizations and the farm community. Using the artistry of floral and interior design, I began to create dinner parties and brunches under my brand, featuring panel-based dialogue surrounding art, gentrification, food sovereignty and justice issues. Artful healing through nourishment is central to every event I?ôve ever created. As of today, I have organized twenty four dinner parties with facilitated conversations focusing on food justice and art. My Collective Impact Dinner?ôs, hosted from 2018-2019, focused on fundraising for local black-led food justice organizations. I am the co-creator of the Simmer Down Picnic series launched in 2016, bringing over two thousand people together and supporting thirty eight budding entrepreneurs such as Two Dough Girls and 95th St Tacos. Most recently, I launched Friends and Neighbors Day Fest in 2019 bringing together fifteen hundred people to encourage marginalized people to heal while playing in green spaces.?I have also been featured in Creative Loafing?, Melanin and Sustainable Style? and Politico Magazine.Maurice SmallMaurice Small is a farmer, trainer of farmers, soil alchemist and worm whisperer in Atlanta, Georgia. As an independent consultant, Small cultivates organic food in urban spaces, creates vibrant soil and nurtures youth leadership in local food system development. For more than 25 years, Small has applied his love and appreciation for the earth, a value he received from his parents, to his work of creating meaningful work for new farmers and communities that care about vibrant local food access.?Maurice Small was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio and most recently has invested his energy in food and farmers in the Southeast. As an innovative creator of national models of sustainable food cultivation and distribution. Small is on the cutting edge of transforming our food systems for the better. Maurice was awarded the Organic Pioneer Award by the Rodale Institute in its inaugural year, 2011. Maurice is a founding and active member of the Farmer x Farmer Coalition.A Black Owned Green Space Dedicated to Health + WellnessWhy This Space Is Important?úFood justice is racial justice. Food and agriculture, like everything in this country, are deeply intertwined with our nation?ôs entrenched history of slavery and structural racism. Our food system actively silences, marginalizes, and disproportionately impacts people of color, who are also being hardest hit by COVID-19.??- Civil Eats EditorsAlso, while cities across the United States have been implementing environmental policies that have led to the rapid growth of green spaces?îparks, community gardens, wilderness areas and urban agriculture?îpublic spaces remain contested ground. Many green spaces are often as segregated as our cities, with the barriers keeping black and brown residents from accessing public space being both visible and invisible. As planners, business-people, city leaders, policymakers, and residents, how can we confront the legacies of violence and exclusion, support and empower those directly affected, and create safe and accessible places that offer social, economic, and recreational opportunities for all?There is both food disparity and disparity within our green spaces for our black community. We hope to become a destination that represents a beacon of change for both of these injustices through creating conversation, sharing stories, educational programming and providing a platform for leadership in the fight against these injustices.?CommunityAccording to Food Well Alliance?ôs 2017 Baseline Report , one in four metro Atlanta families with children are food insecure, three out of four metro Atlanta adults do not consume the recommended 2 1/2 cups of fruits and vegetable daily and one in three metro Atlanta adults are obese. These numbers are shameful, but what?ôs more staggering is how much food is being wasted. ?úBased on the most recent data available, food residuals makes up 12 percent ??or more than 800,000 tons ??of the waste sent to Georgia landfills each year, with approximately 48% coming from the greater Atlanta area. This represents the largest single category of solid waste going into Georgia's landfills.??- EPA . ThinkTable?ôs plan is to rescue and use surplus produce from local farms and food food producers in the Nourish Botanica kitchen and as artisanal canned and preserved products to be sold at Nourish Botanica, thereby diverting the food from being wasted.Our community plan is intended as a cross pollinator that continues to invest in the community through a collective impact approach that includes growers, artists, policy makers and corporate partnerships. Nourish In Black will continue to create an opportunities to highlight growers, grassroots food justice organizers, food producers and creative entrepreneurs.Nourish In Black has raised over $5,000 for grassroots food justice organizations through our dinner parties, and another $2,500 most recently to feed protestors by purchasing from black businesses through our Nourish The People popup, but it's not just about dollars, it's about important dialogue and visual representation.With a physical space we can continue into our eighth year by bringing even more people together for dinners, brunches and life changing conversation. We can continue education on food apartheid, fundraising for food justice organizations and decolonizing the food system by returning to our ancestral knowledge. With our own space, we would finally be the owners of our own narrative while creating an amazing gathering space for our Atlanta community to assemble for change.?Built into our business model, is the ability to donate the space to non-profit organizations and community members for like-minded events or gatherings by application on a monthly basis.?Why We Need HelpYour donation will go towards buying land and then building out the entire business in phases to include:Buying land- $75,000Hiring and labor for architect/contractor to build greenhouse ?- $25,000Building materials for infrastructure of greenhouse and eatery - $30,000Commercial Equipped Kitchen Facility - $35,000Purchasing flowers, herbs, trees, plants and seeds from local farmers - $8,000Fridge for flowers and herbs -$10,000Building and purchasing FF+E (furniture, fixtures and equipment) for the space and design - $10,000HVAC/Plumbing - $15,000Renderings by Philip DavisEvery dollar you donate will be used for this black owned healing space.

Employees want to buy and continue the tradition that has been there for over 150 years.Earlier this year, several of Avery's employees formed a Limited Liability Company (LLC) in order to prepare and be positioned to lease the store space from the current building owner, and ultimately take over the daily operations and management of Avery's General Store. The core staff at Avery's had been looking forward to a relatively smooth transition to becoming an employee owned business. The employees were relying on the completion of negotiations between the current business owner and the new building owner in order for this to take place. Unfortunately, that deal reached an impasse during the second week of March. The current business owner and the building owner have found it impossible to accept each others terms. This has resulted in the store owner making the decision to liquidate Avery's inventory. Simultaneously, the LLC's negotiations with the building owner have come to a standstill due to complications of the non-transition of inventory from the store owner to the building owner, who would have re-sold and financed a note on that asset to the LLC. At this time, it seems there is only one possible way forward for the LLC to have any hope of continuing the legacy of Avery's General Store. That way forward is to find a way to come up with the funding to:1. Purchase any remaining non-liquidated inventory form the current store owner.2. Re-stock the store post-liquidation near to the previous levels.3. Provide adequate operating capital to cover business expenses and payroll as the business recovers.This GoFundMe campaign is our last ditch effort to come up with the funding necessary to help us move Avery's store forward. This campaign was inspired by a number of Avery's customers in our community who have come forward in the past several days. Many have been asking what they can do to help and have offered to provide financial assistance to the LLC if possible.Your donations made here will only be used if we reach our financial goal and move forward with the LLC taking over the store. We are also considering the possibility of additional funding in the form of inventory secured promissory note(s) made to the LLC.

612,Homeless Black Trans women fund,"Created December 17, 2019",Community & Neighbors,"$3,000,000 ","$2,906,620 ",668,274,484,"This fund was started for a small community of Black Trans women living on the streets of Atlanta, many of whom are also sex workers. We now are not only able to help this community, but this project has grown into a unique opportunity to alleviate the chronic homelessness that exists among Trans people in Atlanta, especially among Black & brown Trans people. As of August, we have officially established the Trans Housing Coalition. Through this project, we use the Housing First model to help folks move in and stay in permanent housing and the live the lives they want to lead. We are currently housing nearly 40 trans and non-binary folks. Please visit our website to learn more!Who I AmMy name is Jesse Pratt L√≥pez. I am a Trans Latina from Colombia who calls Atlanta home. I use my experiences as a documentary photographer and grassroots activist to help folks from my community use their voices to resist systems of oppression and step into their own power. I am also now the full-time co-director of the Trans Housing Coalition. You can check out my photography at www.jprattlopez?.photos.Where We StartedI started this fund in mid-December 2019 to help a small group of Trans sisters I had met through ReVon Michaels L√≥pez, my trans daughter.ReVon is a Sagittarius with a huge smile and laugh, and an even bigger appetite. I first met her when she was strutting down the sidewalk in front of a Publix in downtown Atlanta. She was wrapped in a large blanket; her wig haphazardly placed upon her head and her curls as big as her smile. She asked if I could spare some change. I was about to tell her no, I don?ôt carry cash and I?ôm broke. But when I took a closer look, I realized at that moment that I was seeing my sister. My Trans sister. One of the Gurlz. A T-Slur as they like to call us on PornHub.com.I quickly told her that she looked beautiful and that I would be right back with some cash and a sandwich and ? when I returned, she was so happy to see me. I asked her if I could take her picture; I didn?ôt want to forget her.. The rest is her-story.I would come back every couple of days to visit ReVon, or she would come to my house. We hung out, shared food, and she introduced me to the other girls who live and work on the Hoe Stroll ??Piedmont Avenue, Atlanta, Georgia.These girls have been discarded and abandoned by society. They told me stories about getting raped, robbed, shot, and almost killed. Survival sex work has been, historically, the only profession that many Trans women have been able to succeed in. Many girls, especially when they don?ôt ?úpass??for society?ôs ideal archetype of what a woman should be, are denied jobs, housing, and opportunities. How can you exist in a society that believes that you shouldn?ôt even exist?I started documenting the lives of the homeless Black trans women of the Hoe Stroll on Piedmont Ave in Atlanta, GA. While creating this body of work, I walked the stroll with them, not only in order to walk in their shoes, but also because as a Trans woman myself who has experienced housing insecurity, I realized that I had never met another Trans woman who hasn?ôt dealt with housing insecurity and who didn?ôt have to do sex work to survive at some point.Ever since that fateful day I became really close with ReVon?îand the circle of my chosen family became a little bit bigger. I came back every couple days and hung out with and took care of ReVon and the other girls who live and work on the Hoe Stroll on Piedmont Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia. ReVon calls me Mom, I call her daughter. And sometimes the roles are reversed: in the Trans community, we are each other?ôs elders.The Fund: Where It Began and Where It?ôs GoingOnce we became close, ReVon and the girls would share stories about the violence they experienced on the streets of Atlanta: getting raped, robbed, shot, and almost killed. Survival sex work has historically been the only profession that many Trans women have been able to succeed in. Many girls, especially when they don?ôt pass for society?ôs ideal archetype of what a woman should be, are denied jobs, housing, and other opportunities.Through my photography and presence in the Atlanta queer and trans arts and organizing community, I saw a chance to get the girls the support and resources they needed. After initially raising $10,000 through this fund, I was able to secure them temporary housing through the winter holidays and assist with getting them necessities such as food, cell phones, clothes, and spending money. Eventually, I was also able to connect some of the girls to Jayme Stegar, the Lead Trans Outreach Specialist at Someone Cares Atlanta? Jayme was able to assist in finding? two of the girls a room in a rooming house led by Trans people. She has also been instrumental in connecting the girls to STI (sexually-transmitted infections) testing services and ensuring that they have the support to manage their immediate needs.Unfortunately, by April 2020, we had run out of funds, at a time where the need was more pressing than ever in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through contributions from so many generous people, we were able to raise an additional $10,000.Shortly after meeting this second goal, as uprisings ignited across the country to protest the murder and injustice faced by Black lives, this campaign received a resurgence of support. With over 70,000 donors, we have been able to raise $2 million and the fund continues to grow. With this renewed support, it became clear that we can achieve positive, sustainable, and permanent changes for the larger community of Black & Brown Trans women in Atlanta.In June, we created a community advisory board with local Trans-led organizations such as Solutions Not Punishment Collaborative , Southern Fried Queer Pride? and the Trans Atlanta Housing Program , as well as service providers such as Someone Cares Atlanta?, to begin working on a plan composed of smart goals for this transformed project. Further, I?ôve been talking with the girls about their hopes for the future: what they need to build a stable foundation and what is now possible thanks to your support.?With guidance and assistance from these organizations, we were able to establish the Trans Housing Coalition. We utilize the Pathways Housing First model?, based on the idea that ?únothing in any person?ôs history or present precludes them from being able to be housed.??I have benefited greatly from the wise and kind input of Dr. Sam Tsemberis, the founder of Pathways to Housing in New York and originator of the Housing First model. Whether this project looks like funding for existing Trans-led providers or the creation of a new organization is yet to be determined.?Our goal is and always will be to establish permanent housing in Atlanta for Trans people, particularly Black Trans women who are experiencing chronic homelessness and to ensure they have the wraparound services necessary to thrive.If you want to support this, you can also donate directly to us, and avoid the GoFundMe transaction fee:Cashapp: $TransHousingCoPayPal: [email redacted]Venmo: @PaegeTurner (last 4 #s: 6509)Read more?GoFundMe GuaranteeOnly donations on our platform are protected by the GoFundMe Guarantee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was still dressed in my running clothes. And as I neared my home, I passed by a 76-year old woman dressed in a floor length faux mink coat. She was gripping tightly to a railing. ?òYou look great,??I told her.? Then she pointed at my own clothes???òLet me ask you a question,??she said. ?òWhy is it always white boys who wear shorts in the winter??ôAnd thus began my friendship with Stephanie. One of Stephanie's more endearing? traits is that she will launch into a wild story within seconds of meeting a person-- often before customary greetings are exchanged. And that's exactly what she did. She began telling me stories from the 1970's, when she worked as a burlesque dancer named Tanqueray. Her memory for detail was amazing, and she had a singular way of describing things. Stephanie will say the wildest things without a hint of self-consciousness. It really has a way of drawing you in. And after she'd been going for about five minutes, I interrupted for long enough to ask if I could run to my house and get my camera. ?The resulting interview went quite viral, as many of you will remember. And Stephanie had a lot of fun with it.? People were stopping her on the street all day long. And Stephanie loves an audience-- even if it?ôs just an audience of one. So anyone who stopped her for a selfie would leave ten minutes later with an earful of stories. And what stories they were.? Nobody has lived a life like Stephanie?ôs. The two of us agreed to meet regularly at a nearby diner, so I could get her whole story down on paper. We did about twenty interviews together. Our initial plan was to create a podcast. But after we'd gone quite a distance down that path, circumstances suddenly changed.?Stephanie has been in pain for as long as I've known her. When we first met she was walking with a cane. And every time we walked to the diner, she'd grip tightly to my arm. Even then-- it would take us fifteen minutes to travel half a block. She?ôd wince in pain whenever she was jostled or bumped. Occasionally she?ôd scream out. It was clear that something was seriously wrong with her leg. She attributed the injury to a bad fall that she'd suffered a few months earlier, but she seemed confident that she was on the mend. When the pandemic started, Stephanie and I continued our conversations over the phone. She would call me several times a day. And whenever I didn't answer, she'd always leave a voicemail?îusually telling me some story she?ôd just remembered. Last month I grew concerned when a few days passed without hearing from her. I called a neighbor to check up on her, and he heard Stephanie's voice coming from the back bedroom. She'd taken a bad fall and had been on the floor for 72 hours without food or water. The EMTs broke down her door and took her to the hospital.?Ever since the fall, Stephanie has been unable to stand or walk. She is in a lot of pain. She's always been? a private person in many ways, but the current crisis has necessitated a candor about her situation. We?ôve hired a team of professionals to make her apartment clean and comfortable. We?ôve gotten her a 24-hour home health aide. She now has a physical therapist coming to the apartment multiple times a week.? And we're working on handling the back rent and eviction notices. Her health is not improving as quickly as we'd like, but Stephanie remains absolutely convinced that she is on the mend. Unfortunately her unorthodox lifestyle hasn't qualified her for social security. And she doesn?ôt currently have insurance. (Though we're trying to get her signed up for Medicare.) Her care is extremely expensive. So far I?ôve been using funds from the HONY Patreon, but it?ôs not sustainable long term. ??Stephanie and I have decided to scrap our idea of making a podcast. And I?ôve spent the last few weeks retooling the story for publication on Humans of New York. Our plan is to raise funds for Stephanie?ôs care alongside the telling of her story. The ultimate goal is for Stephanie to live the rest of her life on her own terms. Maybe that means an assisted living facility. Maybe that means remaining in her apartment with the assistance of a home health aide. I?ôm not sure. But I want to provide her with enough resources so that it?ôs her decision, and not a decision forced upon her. But I?ôm not viewing this as charity. Stephanie brings a priceless resource to the table?îher story. We're just going to tell that story using a new model.? Instead of selling advertising, or selling it to a publisher, we?ôre asking for voluntary contributions from anyone who?ôs gotten value from Stephanie?ôs narrative. If the story of her life has made you laugh, or cry, or think?îplease consider compensating the person who lived it. Because right now her story is the one thing she has to offer.We are being very thoughtful with the money. Stephanie knows that there are risks involved with publicly raising funds for a person in her vulnerable situation. So with her blessing, we will be placing the money in a trust to ensure that it provides sustainable, long term care. The trust will cover her living expenses and health care needs moving forward. (Which will admittedly be quite extensive.) And at Stephanie?ôs request, any money remaining at the end of her life will be donated to The Association To Benefit Children??îa highly respected New York charity dedicated to helping the city?ôs most vulnerable children.Please consider joining us as we seek to transform Stephanie?ôs life.----------------------------------------------------------Humans of New York is audience supported.If you would like to support Humans of New York, you can do so by joining the Patreon.

As the number of reported arrests rise and the severity of the charges have increased, we have raised that goal to meet increased demand.

Cruelly, many of our neighbors will be left out of this critically important relief simply because of their immigration status. Even documented immigrants are excluded from receiving relief, if they lack a Social Security number. With your help, we will begin to reverse this discriminatory and xenophobic choice and get much-needed money into the hands of immigrant communities - who are already among the hardest hit by the economic impacts of social distancing and other prudent practices.?The need is massive and urgent.

We also encourage people who earned above the threshold for receiving stimulus checks to contribute in a similarly meaningful way (around $1,200). These donations will go directly to the pockets of our immigrant neighbors to support them in the face of new and already existing challenges.?If you are not in a position to donate your entire check, smaller donations are more than welcome! Every donation helps.COVID-19 does not discriminate based on immigration status. The very real concerns faced by many amidst this crisis ??how to pay for rent and food, where to find work, how to take care of our families ??are magnified for immigrants, yet they are completely excluded from any federal government support.?Join us as we continue to pull together in solidarity with our neighbors. Sanctuary DMV, Many Languages One Voice, LaColectiVA, Justice for Muslims Collective, and Restaurant Opportunities Center DC are partnering to directly distribute contributions among immigrants in the DMV (DC/Maryland/Virginia). Sanctuary DMV will also manage a portion of funds that will be directed to individuals and households who are members of the local chapter of the UndocuBlack Network, which supports currently and formerly undocumented Black immigrants.These groups are engaged in organizing and advocacy efforts to change the policies and systems that discriminate against, criminalize, and do violence to our immigrant neighbors ??as well as essential direct service and mutual aid.

The current situation in Six Nations is very intense as the ongoing threat of violence against us has been granted again by the Courts. On Friday August 7th Haldimand County was granted an injunction for the roadways to be cleared of our people. CN also received an injunction for the railway through our community. The interim injunction for 1492 Land Back Lane was also extended to a permanent injunction.

The state needs to stop violently supporting those members of the 1% who are stealing our resources and condemning our children to a world rendered uninhabitable by climate change.Light your sacred fires and come to our aid as the RCMP prepares again to enact colonial violence against Wet?ôsuwet?ôen people.www.yintahaccess.comIf you are hosting an external fundraiser, this is the place to send donations.

626,East Of The River Mutual Aid Fund,"Created March 15, 2020",Community & Neighbors,"$375,000 ","$340,017 ",80,13,27,"In the wake of the COVID-19, the people of D.C. are mobilizing to launch and expand real grassroots mutual aid efforts.Black Lives Matter DC is raising funds for the East of the River Mutual Aid Network in Washington, D.C. Our partners include Black Swan Academy, Peace House DC, Peace Fellowship Church and Stop Police Terror Project DC.?Black Lives Matter DC is a member-based abolitionist organization centering Black people most at risk for state violence in DC, creating the conditions for Black Liberation through the abolition of systems and institutions of white supremacy, capitalism, patriarchy, and colonialism. We are located in Washington, DC,This Mutual Aid Network is a grassroots, community-focused and -led ecosystem for folks in DC (District of Columbia) who are engaged in or are looking to plug in. We are collecting and purchasing supplies to make hygiene bags, purchase groceries and cleaning supplies and provide other support including small home repairs, school supplies, winter coats, assistance with utility bills, and other basic needs that our neighbors have. We are working to support as many of our neighbors who are housing and food insecure as many people as possible who need support East of the River in Wards 7 & 8.We also support other individuals, neighborhoods, groups also doing mutual aid work as we are all in this together and it?ôs up to us to care for each other. Donations go directly to purchasing supplies for hundreds of hygiene bags (toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, deodorant, lotion and soap), baby and adult diapers and wipes, water, toilet paper, and feminine products. We are distributing these as safely as possible by making daily home deliveries, and distributing to our unhoused and housing insecure neighbors in the streets. Our hope is to fill the gaps where the government can?ôt, won?ôt or we don?ôt want them to. #WeKeepUsSafeThis work is critical as Wards 7 & 8 are majority Black and too many of us have bought into the tragic myth that Black people will not/do not get COVID-19?.The reality is that those of us living East of the River face great systematic disparities in almost every facet of lives. Even before the pandemic, the depths of disinvestment East of the River has been devastating to our community, who are 92% Black and account for nearly half of the District's Black population. This includes a lack of real investment in our children, youth, and elders' well-being/health and safety,? very few grocery stores offering fresh fruits and vegetables, the scourge of gentrification and the illusion of affordable housing, a deadly maternal health crisis, and a lack of a full service hospital that can handle the peak in this virus.?If you are new to Mutual Aid and want to know a little more, the Big Door Brigade? provides the following definition:""Mutual aid is a term to describe people giving each other needed material support, trying to resist the control dynamics, hierarchies and system-affirming, oppressive arrangements of charity and social services. Mutual aid projects are a form of political participation in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions, not just through symbolic acts or putting pressure on their representatives in government, but by actually building new social relations that are more survivable.""?Our neighbors East of the River will be impacted in greater ways than large parts of the rest of the district because of the disparity and inequality that has existed for so long. Wards 7 and 8 are in a healthcare dessert with only one deeply troubled hospital, serving 150,000 people with no trauma or OBGYN services. So Others Might Eat (SOME) provides a snapshot? of some of the most serious issues faced on this side of the river:1. Your access to grocery stores depends on whether or not you live in a high-poverty, majority-African-American section of the city. Of the 49 full-service grocery stores in DC, only two are located in Ward 7, and just one is in Ward 8. Those three stores east of the Anacostia River serve about 150,000 residents. In contrast, 10 full-service grocery stores in Ward 6 serve 82,000 residents.2. Washington, DC, has about 700,000 residents. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that about 17% of the DC population is below the federal poverty level, which is now $20,780 for a three-person household:?- 9% are below 50% of the poverty level- 20% are below 125% of the poverty level- About 28% of African-American residents, 13% residents of Hispanic or Latino origin, and 36% of persons with a disability, are at 100% of the poverty level.3. Approximately 41,000 households in DC are on official waiting lists for housing assistance. Their estimated wait time is more than 20 years.?This is why we are asking for your financial support.

My Sistah?ôs House primarily serves TGNC people of color, many of whom have recently been released from incarceration, are experiencing intimate partner violence, and/or are experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity.Expanding on our emergency housing program, our volunteer staff set up a bail fund for incarcerated trans women in the area, and began offering our clients advocacy, legal and multi-level resource assistance to help them secure permanent housing and stable income. Within the last year alone, with limited resources and an all-volunteer staff, My Sistah?ôs House has provided emergency housing to 35 TLGBQ individuals, successfully transitioning them into permanent housing.

Raye and Julian Richardson met at Tuskegee University which they both attended. In 1946 Julian started Success Printing Co. in the Fillmore District of San Francisco and in 1960, the two founded Marcus Books (named after political activist and author Marcus Garvey). Together ??and through both the publishing press and bookstore ??they fiercely advocated for Black history, exchange, and knowledge of self. They published now canonical books (that had before their resurrection gone out of print) and work by independent authors, poets, and artists. Marcus Books is an institution where those who have written books, produced visual work and more can see themselves on a shelf, wall or counter surrounded by other Black makers.Alongside Marcus Books??legacy of Black publishing is an investment in nourishing Black readership, no matter what age. Generations of families have grown up in the store: the student coming to find course material, our incarcerated brothers and sisters writing to put in book orders, the parents who bring their children to the store much like their parents did for/with them. World renowned author or prophetic local poet, elder or toddler, Marcus Books has provided something for you.?At Marcus Books ?úBlack??is not a subject, a single month, or a niche; it is the universe. ""Black??is not just history; it is the present and the future.60 years since its opening, the bookstore has become a literary and cultural hallmark that has hosted iconic authors including Toni Morrison, Rosa Parks, Muhammad Ali, Maya Angelou, Walter Mosley, Angela Davis, Terry McMillan, Chaka Khan, Michael Eric Dyson, Iyanla Vanzant, Sister Souljah, Nikki Giovanni, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Patti LaBelle and so many more of our treasured voices. Just as important are the bookclubs, intimate poetry readings, and countless customer conversations that unfold at Marcus.???Moved by her support for Black bookstores and love for Marcus Books, dedicated Marcus Books customer Folasade Adesanya (founder of The Black Syllabus) began a campaign to raise funds to support the store through its temporary closure due to COVID 19. This pandemic has only exacerbated the struggles that Black bookstores have faced. Between 1999 and 2014, the number of Black bookstores declined by 83%, from 325 to only 54.

Whether you donated financially, shared the link among your social media circles, called the bookstore directly to put in a phone order, or sent your well wishes, our gratitude spills over.?Your support has enabled us to dream beyond the harsh reality of right now and reclaim a future where Marcus Books doesn?ôt just survive but thrives, evolves, and gives back.Our intention with continuing this effort is in line with the bookstore?ôs history: to be in the position to continue to support our community. This, in good faith, requires dreaming beyond our contemporary moment -- a privilege made available through your display of generosity. Funds raised from this continued effort will go toward sustaining Marcus Books and the communities that support it in the following ways:??Getting ahead of an unforgiving and strict loan toward a mortgage on the bookstore property. Ownership of the property (in an increasingly gentrified city) is essential.??Building a robust online presence. We want to better engage our local and national communities through the sale of our essential catalogue of literature and merchandise. Making author readings, book clubs, and discussions available virtually is also crucial. We want to be available to our community, which means making the store?ôs programming available to you, wherever you are.??Expanding our infrastructure, inventory, and staff to account for the evolution of the store.As the Marcus Bookstore family knows well, Julian?ôs daily question at the end of a school or work day was: ?úWhat have you done for your people today???On the 60th Anniversary of the bookstore and what would have been the 100th birthday of its co-founder Dr. Raye Richardson, we hope to continue to respond to that call through Marcus Books.?We thank you enormously for all that you have given toward this fundraising effort.

If you can afford to order your own, please do. Use this form to contact us and we will send you all the info on how to order. Keep in mind, the masks can only be shipped to medical facilities or government entities (otherwise they will be stopped at Customs). This is to prevent hoarding and reselling. Form: bit.ly/KN95OrderingInfo?2) I am a medical professional or administrator at a health, rescue or safety facility.How do I sign up to receive donations?Fill out the donation request form here at https://masks4america.org and one of our volunteers will be in touch!3) I, or my facility, only need a few masks or other PPE.?If you are a small facility or individual healthcare frontliner who needs a small number of masks, we recommend you use Mask Crusader, which pairs PPE donors with recipients: https://maskcrusaders.org4) What are KN95 masks, and is it okay to use them as a substitute for N95s?The CDC lists the KN95 as a recommended substitute when N95 respirator masks are unavailable, as seen here . The FDA also approved KN95 masks? for use in April 2020.?N95 respirator masks are the CDC's default recommended protective facewear for health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients. KN95 respirator masks, used by surgeons and other medical professionals across Asia, are functionally equivalent to N95s. KN95s are basically Asia?ôs version of the N95. For a more detailed comparison, see KN95 & N95 Performance?.While bandanas and fabric masks are better than nothing, frontline health care workers interacting with sick patients need and deserve medical grade PPE masks. We are facing shortages and severe price-gouging in efforts to purchase N95 masks, and KN95s are a much better alternative than bandanas, fabric masks, or reusing N95s.5) How are these masks so cheap?The market price for KN95s is lower than N95s. There is currently a shortage of N95s?, and during this time, many retailers and brokers are price-gouging. Our manufacturer is keeping their prices low and our broker has agreed to waive their cut entirely for masks bought through this effort. As they told us, if everyone else is donating + volunteering, they will too!6) Are you sure this is a legit manufacturer?Yes! Bob Bland has over 15 years of experience in sourcing and manufacturing, which is why she turned her attention to this method of addressing the mask shortage. She found and thoroughly vetted the manufacturer, which is FDA-certified.7) Who decides where the masks go?Our medical advisors, in consultation with other medical professionals who share the needs of their facilities with us directly, and members of government & hospital systems.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She wanted to help the officer who was shot July 2 and remains in the ICU. We (the KCPD) advised he's well cared for, but if she wanted to donate for restaurant or gas station gift cards for his family so they can eat at and travel to/from the hospital, we were accepting those at East Patrol Division. She went on to say she lives in the urban core of Kansas City, and her daughter was murdered in 2012. She said the detectives who worked her daughter's case were like her therapists, fathers, and lifelines all in one.She said she lost her job a month ago and has been struggling to pay her bills. She went to the grocery store last week and found a $1 bill in the parking lot. She used that to buy a lottery ticket, with which she won $100. Her 12-year-old daughter was with her and said, ""Mom, we should give that to the police officer who got shot."" She agreed immediately. With her current financial hardship, we urged her to keep the money. She refused, saying the officer's family needed it, and police needed to know they were supported.We at KCPD shared this wonderful act of humanity on our social media. Then hundreds of people said they wanted to help her out. However, the woman had called from an unlisted number and didn't leave a name. It took a while, but we were able to track her down. Her name is Shetara Sims. She is on the left of this photo (along with KCPD social worker Brooke and Officer Earle). She's a struggling single mom. Even when we found her again, she asked, ""Don't the officer and his family need it more?""?Shetara's act of kindness has touched Kansas City, and they wanted to give back.

This is how we build commUNITY, this is how we build cultures of reciprocity and healing, this is how we build black futures, this is how we care for our people.Every penny, every share on social media, every mention to your friends, every share on IG makes a huge difference.Thank you Brattleboro, we know together we can do this!With love and divine blackness,The SUSU Healing Collectivesusuheals.comRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They live with three other siblings and their parents in a tiny flat near the local hospital where their Dad works as a porter. A frontline worker, he provides their only income. Because the area they live in is overrun with drug dealers and desperate users, they are afraid. They rarely go out. His two older siblings are at college now, an achievement their Mam and Dad are so proud of. Despite their lack of space, room is always made for them to study. This is a happy and close family of eight who struggle everyday. The toughest problem that they'll admit to is, putting food on the table. Just food.The family avail of regular food parcels from the school, consisting of own-brand products, largely tinned non-perishable goods. As others stock up on fresh produce, this is not a luxury afforded to Stephen and his family, they rely solely on the contents of the packs provided.?Everything they get from this fund will be used and spread as thinly as possible. There is no waste in this house. Not food.While the children worry about school and college, (they can't access remote learning and the older siblings used to go to the local library for free wifi when doing their assignments), the parents are worried about the basics, food.?Stephen and his five siblings can't engage in remote schooling because they don't have wifi but they are doing their very best with what books they have.

667,Legal Fees & Support Fund to Divorce Ramsey Orta,"Created June 9, 2020",Community & Neighbors,"$50,000 ","$130,555 ",4.3K,13.6K,4.3K,"I, the wife of Ramsey Orta, am a survivor of domestic violence by Ramsey Orta during the Black Lives Matter movement. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jessica (Hollie) Orta, but I am known by Bella Eiko for live streaming the Occupy Oakland and Ferguson movements.?Over the last few years I have spoken out about my relationship, and marriage, to Ramsey prior to his incarceration. Ramsey physically, mentally, emotionally abused and financially extorted my son and I as I tried to position myself to organize support for him during his incarceration. After I drove to Las Vegas to avoid any further attacks from him, he used the money given to him by the movement to chase me down to Las Vegas and terrorize myself, my son and my then 82 year old Great Aunt. He often threatened me with gang violence and gave my address to people who wanted to harm me as punishment for not staying to endure more of his abuses while supporting him as he negotiated a lesser prison sentence.?In one of our altercations Ramsey physically attacked me by choking me and kidnapping my son for ransom money. You can imagine my shock because of him filming Eric Garner being murdered in the same way. The night before that attack, Ramsey verbally harassed me for not being able to hold in my urination after driving around for over half an hour looking for parking and then walking blocks trying to reach the apartment on Baruch in record breaking cold. These are only a few of the situations I have dealt with during our marriage.?I am asking that the movement that has been supporting Ramsey Orta to hold him, and those who knowingly shielded him from any repercussions for his actions, accountable for his domestic actions towards Black Women. I would also like to be able to go through a divorce process without him abruptly being able to stop it. In November of 2019, he backed away from the divorce proceedings, having his attorney tell me that he would be in touch, after I responded that I would want his assistance for long term therapy for my son and I after being exposed to his violence. Help in this area is greatly appreciated as it is more expensive than I can afford as a single mother.?I also would like the movements, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Oakland, Hands Up Don't Shoot & I Can't Breathe, to take action in keeping my son and I safe. I have had to move away from the city far from my friends and family because I feel I am in danger if I were ever to return, especially with him now having access to his welcome home fund, coupled with the blind support of many Black Lives Matter supporters.?I have been an organizer and given my life to this movement as a Black Woman, and this movement has only stood against me in support of Ramsey Orta. I am asking that this movement consider how it will move forward if it continues to silence Black Women? and overlook the bad action of their heroes. The plausible alternatives for police in handling these kinds of situations moving forward are conversations that I?ôve been trying to have for years.I am not asking for police involvement. If I wanted to handle this with the police, I would have pressed charges on Ramsey but I am adamantly against the continuation of the prison industrial complex. I strongly believe in police abolition but we cannot continue to build a movement in which black women and black children continue to be targets of misogyny in their households. You cannot continue to praise someone for a single action, when they've attacked and perpetrated violence towards the most vulnerable people in your community. In order to talk about police abolition we must also talk about the future we wish to replace it with. We will not be able to accomplish that safe future if we don't hold accountable the actions of individuals that resemble those of the same patriarchal system.?With love & All Power to the People,?Bella EikoRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It?ôs time to tell the truth.?The devastating effects of colonisation, family separation and racism, have pushed our people to be the most imprisoned people on earth which means we?ôre also more likely to die in police or prison custody. Aboriginal women are the fastest-growing prison population, and almost all of our people in prison are themselves victims of violence.Next year it will be 30 years since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody handed down its findings. The Royal Commission was meant to put an end to Black deaths in custody but the Commission?ôs findings are still gathering dust, and 437 of us have died in police or prison cells since.?We have been told by politicians, bureaucrats, and other decision-makers to wait for change, that justice and progress takes time, but how much more time do we need to wait? No one has been held accountable for our deaths in custody or for the daily police violence we endure.Waiting has taken the lives of 437 of us. We aren?ôt willing to wait anymore.We need your help. We are a small (but mighty!) organisation. We do not have the funds for the extensive campaigning and advocacy that is needed to end Black deaths in custody in this country.?We are asking for your financial support to continue the vital and critical work we do for our communities. With your support, we can work with and support the families devastated by these tragic deaths, amplify their voices and together campaign for an end to Black deaths in custody. We won?ôt leave another family behind in grief because of the death of their loved one in a police or prison cell.With your support, we will hire a dedicated Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander campaigner and advocate to work closely with the families who have had their loved ones die in custody. They would jointly create a campaign to end Black deaths in custody that is led by those most affected: the families left behind. Money raised will also support the families to be involved.?Prisons are not safe or effective. We are haunted by the images of the hooding and gassing of children at Don Dale, to the damning footage uncovered through so many black deaths in custody coronial inquests.?We have the solutions to ending Black deaths and the over imprisoning of our people. Our solutions are based on decarceration, self-determination, community-control, accountability and true justice for our people. We want better access to Custody Notification Services, more culturally safe support for families and women and survivors of violence, appropriate housing and social safety nets, higher age of criminal responsibility, police accountability, alternatives to imprisonment, and ending abuse and human rights violations in custody. We want to see all of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommendations implemented.?We have waited long enough, we will not wait any longer.We have been watching what?ôs happening in the United States with sadness and solidarity. In Australia, a handful of politicians have tried to distance us from what?ôs happening there. This is wrong, Australia is no better - we need to tell the truth.Currently, there are two police officers awaiting trial for the murder of Aboriginal people who have been fatally shot. But there has never been a conviction for a black death in custody.?With your financial support, we can tell the truth that needs to be told: that in Australia no police officer has ever been convicted for the death of our people in their custody. In fact, police are more likely to be promoted than charged.Together, we can advocate for accountability for Black deaths and for a justice system based on the strengths of our culture, of healing, and of truth-telling. With your donation, we can ramp up our campaign to end Black deaths in custody by implementing all of the recommendations of the Royal Commission.?At this moment, we are being heard more than ever.?

We support members with experiences of violence and the criminal justice system to create change; in their own lives, communities and society.?4FRONT was established in 2012 to provide a platform for young people who have been impacted by violence to create change. Since then, 4FRONT has pioneered an approach that empowers the young people most directly harmed by violence and the criminal justice system to be at the forefront of a grassroots movement for change.?Racial inequity drives violence. The criminal justice system drives violence. Unaccountability drives violence. We are building a powerful youth-led movement to transform the way peace and justice are understood by centring healing rather than punishment. Our work centres transformative justice and healing whilst directly challenging the UK?ôs addiction to criminalisation, policing and prisons. We are transforming the way in which society understands how to support communities affected by violence and shaping the agenda around how to address the systemic causes of it.How we fight for justice:- Exposing structural injustice- Mobilising those most affected by injustice- Building transformative justice practicesHow we fight for peace:- Supporting members to heal and promoting radical self care- Building community accountability- Advocating for approaches that increase safetyHow we fight for freedom:- Building pride in our cultural identity- Creating space to envision freedom- Providing anti oppression and liberation educationCALL TO ACTIONThe criminal justice system is the only apparatus that exists to deal with violence at a societal level but many fail to acknowledge the extreme harm this system inflicts at every level. From policing to prisons, the criminal justice system is inherently violent in nature and this perpetuates the violence in our communities. If we truly want to understand the impacts of violence on young people and our communities, we must acknowledge all the ways in which we are exposed to violence. Young people who experience violence and the criminal justice system rarely access holistic services? which are designed to meet their specific needs.?Our work centres racial justice and empowers members to recognise their strengths and identify systemic barriers to their progress. We specialise in providing culturally specific services, tailored to meet the needs of those with experiences of violence and the criminal justice system who identify as Black (which includes those who are Black British, African, Caribbean and Mixed Heritage). We not only acknowledge the impact of racism and discrimination on our members, we actively work to dismantle these systems.The horrific murder of George Floyd has reinvigorated a global movement to end police violence and racial injustice.

As we all do our best to cope with the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic, life as we know it has changed immensely in just a few short days. On Monday, March 16th Governor Whitmer announced a mandatory closure of all places of public gathering including restaurants, bars, and fitness centers. ?It's important to note that we are in full support of whatever mandates our local and national governing bodies put in place. Beyond any economic threat, at AFS we?ôre fully aware that the big picture game we should all be playing is saving lives by adhering to CDC recommendations and limiting contact.?At the time of Governor Whitmer?ôs mandate, AFS did not foresee this level of a shutdown coming. At that time we were more so preparing to be open, but to have greatly reduced occupancy. As time has gone on, all indications we're seeing is that this closure (especially in our industry) will be extended beyond the original expiration of March 31st. As that date approaches, we as a team have had to make some very difficult decisions. The kind no leader wants to make.?On April 1st a membership auto payment is scheduled to be extracted from all AFS member accounts. We (as a company) have decided NOT to process any auto payment if the shutdown is extended. This means there will be NO fees deducted whether you're engaging with our online community or not if the shutdown continues. This same stance will be taken if the shutdown is extended into May.?We feel that the very reason we've gotten the support we've gotten from our community is that we've always tried our best to put the greater good ahead of our own. So even though our survival as an entity is in question, this is not the time to change who we are. We're certain there are a good number of AFS members who are facing a financial hardship right now and extracting those funds, if our facilities are closed, is simply not an option. ?We're currently working with all of our creditors and the banks to defer payments and try to access any funding available. The reality is the funding we need so immediately simply isn't there right now. Regardless of the financial impact on our business, the true outcome of the decision to not charge our 4/1 autopay means we cannot pay anyone on staff. Our entire team (leadership included) has been effectively ""laid off"" indefinitely and everyone is working on getting on unemployment now. Not surprisingly, our team has been resilient, focused, and service oriented throughout this entire process, and laying everyone off won?ôt be changing that. Although we all just got ""fired,"" our volunteer workforce is going to continue to do everything we can to continue to serve you how we?ôve been throughout the start of this crisis. Practitioners will continue to work with their clients virtually (prescribing workouts and doing meetings. Our entire remaining volunteer team will keep the online Facebook Virtual Hub humming for as long as possible. **UPDATE #1: We reached our first threshold of $50,000! In a DAY! When we set up this page, we had no idea what the outcome would be and honestly, we felt really bad putting a goal that directly reflects what our monthly payroll cost is because it's high. AFS' monthly payroll cost is $155,000 and we will continue adjusting our goal as we go along. We are overwhelmed with the support we've received thus far, it's truly been incredible! We love you all!**UPDATE #2 4/3/2019: Our community came out in droves to support our employees in the months of March and April and we're so excited that in addition to that, the federal government has stepped up and is providing more than adequate compensation to our team (full paychecks covered AND then some). Knowing our people are taken care of is truly the number 1 priority for AFS and we've breathed a huge sigh of relief as this has unfolded this past week. With the $85,000 you all have contributed AND the unemployment benefits, our team is good!!With those developments, we've now shifted our focus to the business itself. We've applied for the PPP, the EIDL, and every grant we can find, but so have all of the other small businesses (rightfully so) and the time frame in which this monetary relief is coming is COMPLETELY up in the air. We've put off as many bills as we can, but our accrued April and May expenses that we were unable to get deferred total $184,000 (keep in mind this is a 3 facility total which is why that's a high number) so that becomes our new target. Do we expect our community to cover this entire thing? Absolutely not. Every little bit helps us to stick around when this thing ends.With gratitude, humility, and love,The AFS Family#SmallBusinessReliefRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It ended by affirming support of the Black Lives Matter movement and calling for allies to ""break the cycle of trauma created by racism and violence.""The next week, members of the?Barron County Board of Supervisors executive committee went into closed session to discuss the county's relationship with Embrace. After gaveling back into open session, the board?voted to stop funding the organization?by cutting $25,000 slated to go to the advocacy group next year. Supervisors also voted to have the county's director of Health and Human Services resign from Embrace's board of directors.?County HHS director Stacey Frolik didn't discuss what happened during the closed session, but told WPR the dispute between the county and Embrace started when ""there was some outward facing support for Black Lives Matter.""?She said before the Embrace statement went public it was presented to the group's board of directors, of which she was a member at the time. She said she and other board members indicated that the statement shouldn't have been released.""And from a departmental standpoint, I was not feeling comfortable continuing on as a board member of Embrace, just knowing kind of the stance that they were taking with, you know, with law enforcement,"" said Frolik. ""That made me very uncomfortable personally and professionally.""Frolik said Embrace has been serving as the county's domestic violence and sexual assault advocate for just over a year. Before that, she said the county had one employee who focused on those services. As a result, Frolik said the county didn't have the ""depth of services"" that it currently does.She said?the $25,000 that would have gone to Embrace is still in the county's budget for domestic abuse services. The county still refers domestic abuse survivors to Embrace, but Frolik said that?funding could possibly be used on direct assistance?for survivors if the relationship between Embrace and the county deteriorates further.Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald had already resigned from the Embrace board prior to the statement issued at the end of September, in part because of signs posted by Embrace supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, which he said advocates for defunding police departments. Fitzgerald said the group's support could alienate some victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, particularly those with ""law enforcement relationships.""""We were some big supporters of Embrace and we felt that they were not supporting law enforcement and taking the side of some of the anti-law enforcement out there,"" said Fitzgerald.Fitzgerald said?while the relationship has been cut, his department will still refer victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to Embrace for services.?Embrace Executive Director Katie Bement said Barron County's decision to cut the $25,000 in future support caught them by surprise. She said the organization's support of the Black Lives Matter movement is not a criticism of local law enforcement agencies.??""We really have this understanding that racism, police violence, sexual violence and domestic violence all have the same root causes and they interact and compound on each other, both in society and the survivors we serve,"" said Bement. ""So, we feel we can't remain silent and neutral in the face of violence and oppression, or we're doing harm.""She said none of the survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault they work with have complained about the statement or support of Black lives Matter. Bement said local police and Embrace should be able to disagree without defunding services that survivors of violence depend on.?Dave Willingham is the chair of Embrace's board of directors. He said the statement issued at the end of September was reviewed by board members and while some ""expressed more misgivings about some of the language than others,"" no members said it shouldn't be released.?Willingham said the idea that Embrace's support of Black Lives Matter is akin to calling for local law enforcement agencies to be defunded isn't accurate.?""And so it seemed ironic to me that somebody would object to the words 'Black Lives Matter' on the basis that it represents defund the police, and then turn around and advocate for defunding Embrace,"" said Willingham.?Bement and Willingham said they're hoping to meet with the Barron County Board of Supervisors Executive Committee to explain their statement and advocate for the return of their 2021 funding.?Embrace isn't the first victims advocacy organization to support anti-racism efforts and the Black Lives Matter Movement. In July, The Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault and End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin issued a joint letter titled ""Moment of Truth.""?It said the coronavirus pandemic, increased police violence and political and economic upheaval produced the ""perfect storm"" that advocacy organizations have to face.?""We have spent decades building our movement?ôs voice and power,"" said the letter. ""How we use them now will define us in the years ahead. Let our actions show that we did not stand idly by.

This is the second GoFundMe campaign we've run in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing alteration to everyday life we've all experienced. Days after the Governor's executive order to shutter non-essential businesses we put out a call for help to our community to ensure our team of volunteer trainers and coaches had financial security in the midst of the chaos as the government got to work on boosting unemployment benefits and putting together an economic stimulus. We are absolutely ecstatic to report to you that BOTH our community and the government came through. In what was nothing short of miraculous the AFS community raised upwards of $90,000 to cover economic hardships for our team in less than 3 weeks! This fund our supporters created in addition to government help now has us feeling very good about the financial wellbeing of our team. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much! Thank you doesn't even do it justice.With the Stay At Home orders now extending into mid-May, AFS is once again faced with the reality that we will NOT be running the autopayment on May 1st; which generates almost all of our revenue as a business. As we?ôve said before, we are committed to not billing clients if we cannot be opened; it is the only right thing to do during this difficult time. Although we have been approved for some government funding, the financial impact of these funds is quite minimal compared to the overall financial cost of running AFS for even a short period of time. ?Given the already fragile financial state the company was in before the pandemic, those funds will not provide the support we need to minimize financial losses in our business. We are also well aware that the months ahead will be difficult even when we are allowed to open. While some enthusiasts will eagerly rush back into the gym, a great deal more will be extremely hesitant. We anticipate the government will impose reduced occupant capacities in our facilities, further limiting utilization. All of this adds up to a turbulent financial period ahead for AFS. The money we will raise from this fund is simply to minimize losses and, therefore, be able to maintain the operations of AFS, given the uncertainty that lies ahead. If anyone is curious as to our specific financial position, or how this money will be used, we want to be very transparent and are happy to share. Please email AFS CEO Mike Stack ([email redacted]) for this information. We are very aware that many small businesses are experiencing the same financial hardship and uncertainty we face, we empathize with them, and can only hope they will be blessed with the same strong support from their community as well. Just as we did in April, the AFS team will be operating in full force to provide the virtual experience of streaming workouts, yoga, expert talks, and more on our community HUB page. We've committed to keeping this community open access for all who need it and have adopted a ""Take what you need, leave what you can"" approach to operating the hub. If you're one of our many avid supporters, we greatly appreciate the donations you made in April and if you have the means to do so we will humbly accept them in the month of May as well. For those who may be slightly less familiar with AFS, but have been getting some value from the content we're putting out, we simply ask that you consider a small donation. For any who are engaging but simply do not find themselves in the financial situation to give, we totally understand and are eager to serve your needs during this time anyway.?Thank you all so much for your love and attention.

In parallel, many families are struggling to make ends meet and providing delicious, healthy meals is becoming increasingly difficult as grocery stores are running out of everything. We are raising money today so that we can pay local restaurants to make food for those in need. This will allow restaurants to pay their employees and keep their lights on.

This virus can be devastating to our elderly, disabled, and medically compromised friends and neighbors. Social distancing is one of the certain ways that we can lovingly stop it from spreading and protect these vulnerable members of our community.?Musicians, DJ?ôs, dancers, visual artists, arts presenters, actors, filmmakers, spoken word artists, comedians, teaching artists?îall of these people's jobs rely on people showing up and being able to access their work. In Durham, we are now seeing canceled events through the end of the month. This trend and its impact is likely to be felt well beyond the spring season. To add insult to injury, a large percentage of artists supplement their incomes with part time jobs, often in the service industry, another industry that will be hit hard by this pandemic.?That is why we?ôve started this fundraising campaign.WHY THIS MATTERS FOR OUR CITYCreative practice, innovation and art have been woven into the culture of Durham since its inception. Durham arts presenters and arts venues have attracted diverse talent to our city for decades, all while infusing our city with economic viability.Today, we stand on the shoulders of Baba Chuck Davis, Pauli Murray, Brother Yusuf Salim and many more who lit the path of creative practice in our city.?Artists in Durm have known for some time now that the rapid gentrification we are experiencing is increasing the financial pressures for artists and arts venues in lockstep with Phase of development. With every new high-rise that pops up in our skyline, another art space shutters its doors and another artist's practice is pushed out of the city.If you came to Durham because of the creative energy...If you thrive in Durham because of the work of artists...If you have a favorite local artist, mural, song, venue...or if you simply know (and have been knowing) that we are going to *need* artists now, more than ever, if we have any hope of getting through this year with our souls intact?¶PLEASE SUPPORT THIS FUND!************************************************************************************************APPLY FOR SUPPORTIf you are an artist, arts presenter or arts venue in need of funds:Click Here? to take our survey and apply for relief funding.************************************************************************************************HOW FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTEDThe distribution of funds is being managed by Heather Cook at NorthStar?, with consultation and support from a team of Durham creatives including:?Kym Register, Monet Marshall, Marcella Camara, Saba Taj, Laura Ritchie, Angel Dozier, Meg Stein, Megan Bowser and Jaclyn Bowie.Several of the organizers of this fundraiser are also artists or arts presenters who may also need to apply for funding through this program.

Please consider giving another gift to fuel our initiative and share to everyone you know.? **DONATE > SHARE > FOLLOW US ON IG: DurhamFreeLunchWith humble thanks, Durham Free Lunch.HISTORY OF DURHAM FREE LUNCH INITIATIVE:Durham Public Schools students and many of their families need food. Our homeless population is struggling more than ever to access food as restaurants and volunteer groups limit their hours, and the public becomes more reluctant to give. Thousands of workers, particularly in the service and restaurant industry, are currently laid off. The need is urgent, and the time to act is now.In response, the Durham Neighbors Free Lunch Initiative was born. Its goal is to provide contactless FREE meals, Monday-Friday, through our local restaurant partner Geer Street Garden. These meals will be made with local ingredients, prepared by workers paid a living wage, and given to anyone who needs them, no questions asked. As a starting point, we will provide *200+ meals per day, 5 days per week (Monday - Friday), from April 9 - TDB.The initiative addresses the following 3 issues:- Provide healthy, accessible meals for anyone who is food insecure. Our focus is Durham Public Schools students, our homeless population, and workers who have been laid off in relation to COVID-19. That being said, anyone in need of a meal can have it.- Support our local farms who have lost markets for their goods as wholesale buyers and restaurants shut down.- Put a restaurant back into service and pay a living wage to 4 employees, 20 hours per week (with more to follow), in a safe and healthy capacity.We take the health and safety of the workers, volunteers, and public very seriously. All operations will be following or superseding the recommendations of medical health authorities. All workers, organizers, and volunteers will go through a verbal health check in and have their temperature taken before beginning shifts. All workers, organizers, and volunteers will use recommended PPE (personal protective equipment) during operations, including face masks, gloves, and approved cleaning materials. Meals will be served in a ?úcontactless??fashion and physical distancing of at least 6 feet will be in place.This is a grassroots, community supported, direct action food program. We feel strongly that the time to take action on hunger is right now, so we will begin serving meals this week at Geer Street Garden. Those that need food may have it, and those that can pay for their meals are welcome to. If you are able to give more than the cost of your meal, that pays for the next person. Until all are fed.Please give a gift today if you are able!? We are also in need of volunteers, please contact us if you have the ability to volunteer.Solidarity, not charity.Elijah King, Founder of Youth NXT, Student activistGrant Ruhlman, local business owner, Homebucha KombuchaGeorge O'Neal, local farmer, Lil Farm Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's time to tell the State and Commonwealth Governments NO WAY to the no jab no job laws that have been introduced. We must also stand up to the beauracracy and say NO to any mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. The State and Commonwealth Governments have introduced legislation which compel people to have flu vaccinations. Soon enough they will try and force and or coerce people to have a COVID-19 vaccination.Scomo announced on 19 August 2020 that he intends to make it mandatory for all Australians to have the COVID-19 vaccination to be made available by the end of 2020 / early 2021.This is in breach of various provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) and section 51(xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act.Section 51(xxiiiA) was introduced into the Constitution to provide that whilst the Commonwealth Parliament can validly make laws with respect to the provision of benefits and for medical services, it is not authorised to make laws providing for the complete control of medical services rendered by any person to any other person.Nor does the Commonwealth legislature have the power to control the practice of the medical profession completely or to such less extent as Parliament might think proper.The High Court considered this way back in 1949. The then Chief Justice Latham was concerned with the power of the Commonwealth to control and conscript physicians' services through economic conscription. He defined 'civil conscription' in the following way:""The term 'civil conscription' is wider than industrial conscription. It is applicable in the case of any civilian service, i.e. non-military, work or service. It could properly be applied to any compulsion of law requiring that men should engage in a particular occupation, perform particular work, or perform work in a particular way.""He also alluded to European history before and during World War II saying:""There could in my opinion be no more effective means of compulsion than is to be found in a legal provision that unless a person acts in a particular way he shall not be allowed to earn his living in the way, and possibly in the only way, in which he is qualified to earn a living.""Latham CJ stressed the importance of this and said that any service to which the limitation applied should be completely voluntary and not procured by compulsion of law.The constitutional objective was to safeguard the right to be free from governmental interference in making choices about one's health care. This is a fundamental civil right.This means that the State and Commonwealth Governments are unable to introduce any laws that compel individuals to have a flu shot or any mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. Any laws that try to do that are unlawful and should be struck out.It also means that the Governments are unable to enforce any laws that purport to say that a person is unable to be employed or work in a particular industry or refrain from entering into a particular premises for failing to have a flu shot or COVID-19 vaccination.If you have been fired from your job for not having a flu shot or COVID-19 vaccination, refused entry into an aged care facility for not providing proof that you have had a flu shot or COVID-19 vaccination, refused access to premises or the provision of goods and services for not having a flu shot or COVID-19 vaccination, then this fundraiser is there to protect your civil rights.All funds raised will go towards the legal battle ahead. Nathan Buckley, the promoter of this campaign is a lawyer and Partner of G&B Lawyers, a Sydney city based law firm who believes in the protection of fundamental freedoms for all Australians. Nathan is an experienced litigator and is admitted to the roll of practitioners on the High Court of Australia.The contributions that people put forward will support your fellow Australians who choose not to have a flu vaccination or COVID-19 vaccination, to gain justice, help those Australians to get on with their lives and return to normal as quickly as possible. It will protect all Australians' fundamental right to choose whether or not to have a flu vaccination or COVID-19 vaccination.Like all Australians, I will forever be grateful to all contributors who free Australia from the draconian and unlawful laws that have been introduced by State and Commonwealth Governments in recent months.The target is large so as to cover any costs order against us if we are unsuccessful.As we now have a number of matters in the Fair Work Commission jurisdiction that may result in test cases specifically within the scope of this campaign, all donations will be used to pay legal costs and disbursements towards any such matter which may become a test case in either the Federal Circuit Court or the Federal Court. Accordingly, there is no functionality to issue any refunds.?Updates on the progress of each test case will be provided as the matters progress.Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was taken from his beautiful family on Saturday, 2 May 2020 (his 46th birthday) by a random and catastrophic brain anurysum.It's incredibly difficult to understand how and why something like this can happen to such an incredible and selfless man, and a family who've already endured so much.? Sarah, Oscar's wife, who he adorded wholeheartedly, was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2007, and was originally expected to live only 3-18 months. That was 13 years ago and we are blessed beyond words that Sarah is still here with us.? But this hasn't come without it's challenges. After intense treatment and three brain surgeries, Sarah has physical and cognitive impairments that prevent her from working and driving.? Oscar was the income-earner, driver, and primary carer to Sarah, while together the two of them raised their beautiful boys, Joe and Will, now 17 and 14.As you can imagine, this will have a significant impact on Sarah and the boys in so many ways. There are also significant costs for Oscar's private funeral and buriel service. Many people from the amazing Mamalai community have asked how they can contribute and have asked to set up a Go Fund Me page to help with financial assistance. While Sarah and the boys are not completely comfortable with this, they have accepted it, and understand why it's important to embrace the gift of generosity.??In Oscar's PNG culture, if someone gives you a gift you graciously accept it, with much love and gratitude. This is what Sarah and the boys will do.?Everyone who knew Oscar knows he had a lot of love to give and was always there for others. He put the needs of others ahead of his own. And while he was incredibly generous, his own strength of character and pride made it difficult for him to ask for, or accept, help, but he did when they needed it most.?We have also set up a page in the app ""Gather My Crew"". People can register to help Sarah and the boys with a range of things, from meals, garden maintenance, transport etc. There is currently not much on there but if you register now you will be notified of 'tasks' available to help the family. This is the invitation that people can follow to the website - https://app.gathermycrew.org/action/invitesecret=77d344c46ff38543c44a781371d0dbf7?With love and gratitude, always xxxRead more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently it is zoned for stays under 30 days.??As of August 3, 2020 a STOP WORK ORDER has been issued against the owner of the property due to violations.? They will not be able to proceed with any work for the time being.Last week a committee was formed with people from within the community.? ?Also as of August 3, 2020 a lawyer has been retained.? All money raised from the Go Fund Me will be used strictly for legal expenses incurred by the law firm retained for the purpose of putting a stop to this facility, in accordance with the broad approval of the local community (a recent petition was signed with over 2400 signatures by local community members). The law firm hired is Harris Beach.  We will be represented by Jack Martins.  There is no process without Due process. The government entity cannot circumvent laws and procedures without repercussions. We urge you to please join us and raise money to support our efforts to force local officials to STOP this facility from opening in order to help preserve the safety and well being of our families and neighborhood.? This money will be strictly used for all legal services necessary to fight this.? At this time there is no plan or approved decision on how any extra funds will be used.?

People are filling up their own trollies and cupboards to try to deal with the panic of an unknown pandemic - and food banks up and down the country are running out of food.As the impact of coronavirus takes hold, and the knock on effect of unpaid work, unfulfilled contracts, zero hours workers getting literally zero hours, new universal credit claims (currently a six week delay, who knows how much longer it will be with so many new claims to process?!), More and more people are going to find themselves at the door of the food bank, only to find that their shelves are empty too.It's my birthday today (17th March) and I'm sitting here on my sofa at half past midnight truly thankful to be seeing another birthday at all. But all I want - really - is for people to dig as deep as they can and help restock struggling food banks so that the most vulnerable people in our neighbourhoods can access a little help in this precarious and difficult time.People who can't afford to stockpile. People who buy their shopping in meagre amounts day to day. People who were already struggling who now won't be able to make ends meet.We don't know how Covid19 is going to end up. We have no idea of the impact on our economy, society, communities. But poverty is already isolating, lonely, and exhausting.

Our family and friends placed our sights on 96.71 acres of land at the edge of Toomsboro, GA in Unincorporated Wilkinson County Georgia. Our land is just 6 minutes from the Oconee River and Balls Ferry National Park. We were able to purchase our land utilizing cooperative economics. Together 19 relatives and close friends will begin a new development for our elders to retire, our families to enjoy vacation homes, and to create a thriving safe haven for BIPOC all over. We hope to create a space for our family and yours to enjoy family reunions, weddings, healing retreats, marriage conferences, youth survival programs, and apprenticeship programs in farming and construction.?When we purchased the land we set out to build it for ourselves and do this for ourselves, and to be a model for other families and friends to create their own communities. Upon purchase of the land, our post went viral and people from all over started commenting, sharing, and asking how could they help us on our mission. So here we are providing an opportunity for all of our extended family and friends who want to be apart of this movement to donate toward bringing amenities and utilities to the land before our big celebratory event on Labor Day Weekend that we are calling the BIG BLACK Campout?.We asking for your help to raise $88,000 to help clear the land, hire a team to build roads, pavilions, gazebos, & benches, dig a well for water, create a small camping supply store, connect electricity, and install Wi-FI capabilities to make our Black-owned private land a premier event site for Black families in the age of social distancing.

Knowbility produce the 22nd annual Accessibility Internet Rally (AIR) competition?? Since 1998, AIR has raised awareness and improved skills in accessible design in the context of a fun, friendly web raising competition. In 2020, we are challenged to keep the program funded - will you help? AIR programs are typically supported by business sponsors and foundation grants In 2019, $65K in sponsor dollars and grant fund covered costs for training, NPO coaching, technology infrastructure, and other program management costs. Since COVID, those funding sources are few and far between for small nonprofits like Knowbility. As we learn to teach, learn, socialize, evangelize, and innovate in an all-new context, we turn to our community for a new way to fund AIR activities this year. Please donate if you can. Evangelizing Accessibility from the GrassrootsThe Internet is not equally accessible to people with disabilities and AIR shows web pros how to change that. In these times when we are all working, learning, shopping, and participating in civic and social activities remotely, accessibility has never been more important. And yet, the most recent State of Accessibility Report (SOAR?) found that more than 80% of public websites are not accessible. Through the years, the Accessibility Internet Rally (AIR) program has served as the Johnny Appleseed of accessibility, spreading seeds of good design with creativity and joy. AIR introduces web professionals and students to digital accessibility with a fun, friendly web raising competition that benefits community organizations, musicians, and artists. Produced at least once a year in cities as far-flung as Austin, Dallas, Houston, Denver, LA, San Francisco, and Boston, we are now learning to stay home and spread the word in a new way.?Thousands of people have been introduced to accessibility in the AIR competition or AccessU - and you may be one of them! Many have gone on to work in accessibility for companies like Pearson, Adobe, Microsoft, Visa, Google, Apple, and Facebook. You will find former AIR participants at startups, digital agencies, and schools as well.? AIR alumni work for large accessibility consultancies like Deque and LevelAccess.? AIR is people-centered and focused on the lived experiences of people with disabilities. We use heirloom seeds rather than industrial methods to change the world of digital accessibility.? And it all began as a community collaboration in Austin, Texas.? The need for accessibility has never been greater - please help us continue to spread the word and change design practices to meet the needs of all people. Please give what you canNo gift is too small. We understand that there are competing needs in these hard times. But if you care about equal access to digital information and interactions, please chip in what you can. Together we can continue to improve understanding and commitment to accessibility.

Dave is also a substitute teacher when he's not on tour competing and became new father this past year.?What should be an exciting time preparing for this major competition has turned into one of stress. Unfortunately, the National Sport Federation for skeleton, Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton, has taken the unusual step of requiring Dave to pay for 100% of the costs of his World Championship trip and giving him only two days notice before he has to leave. The National Organization is funding the other Canadian athletes attending this race.?

This circuit has significantly less resources available to its Canadian athletes (less coaching, no therapy, etc.), and earns lower points for race results. ?Points are used to qualify participants at key races like World Champs. In addition, Dave and the other second-tier athletes already effectively self funded 90% of their season!?Canadian skeleton athletes receive a small amount of money from Sport Canada each year but are not paid to do the sport. Each athlete is responsible for almost all their costs, including team fees, training, competition, equipment, etc. ?Most Canadian skeleton athletes work part time or full time jobs to support their racing passion, and rely heavily on any sponsorship they may be able to find.Dave is known as Grizz in the skeleton world due to his consonant-heavy last name (""Greszczyszyn"") and the picture of a grizzly bear adorned on his helmet!

It has given me the determination and drive to not let anything stop me from pursuing my dream. Having to fight and work harder than many has made me into the responsible go-getter that I am today.

Pour organiser au mieux ce concours et pouvoir offrir ces diff√©rents prix aux enfants, nous voulons vous demander votre soutien afin de rendre tout cela possible, et donner la possibilit√© ? nos enfants de mieux appr√©cier notre culture et l'apprentissage de notre langue.?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ÿ¶?ÿ≤?ÿ≤ ??ÿ±??ÿØÿßÿ¥?ÿßÿ±? ⁄æ??????ÿ≤⁄Ø? ÿ¶ÿß?ÿß? ÿ®??ÿ∫ÿß?ÿØ?? ??ÿ™?????ÿ≤ÿØ??? ÿÆ??????ÿ≤ ÿÆ?ÿ™ÿß? ÿØ???ÿ™???⁄≠ ??ÿ≥ÿ™??????ÿ≥? ÿ¶ÿßÿ≥ÿ™?ÿØÿß ÿ¶?ÿ±?? ??ÿ±ÿ∫????????ÿß ÿ¶??ÿ±ÿßŸæ? ????? ???ÿ¨?ÿ™??ÿ∫? ÿ™?⁄æÿØ?ÿØ?? ÿ¶??ÿ±ÿß?ÿßÿ™?ÿß? ??ÿ¥??ÿØÿß? ÿ¶?ÿ∫?ÿ± ?????ÿ±ÿØ? ? ?????ÿ™???ÿ≤⁄Ø? ÿ¶ÿßÿ≤ÿ±ÿß? ÿ®??ÿ≥??? ÿ¶???ÿØ ÿ¶???Ÿæ ????ÿ¥ ? ÿ¶?ÿ≤???ÿ≤?? ÿ≥ÿß??ÿßŸæ ????ÿ¥ ÿ±?⁄æ???ÿ≤?? ??????ÿØ?ÿ±?ÿ¥ ÿ¶???? ? ÿ®?ÿ≤ ¬´ ÿØ???ÿß ÿ¶??ÿ∫?ÿ± ÿ¶ÿß?ÿß??ÿßÿ± ÿ®?ÿ±???? ¬ª ?ÿßÿ¥ ? ÿ¶?ÿ≥??ÿ±??ÿ±???ÿ≤??⁄≠ ÿ¶???ÿØ??? ÿ™ÿß?ÿß?ÿ™ ÿ¶?⁄Ø???ÿ±??? ÿ®ÿß??ÿßŸæ ????ÿ¥ ÿ¶ÿßÿ≥ÿßÿ≥?ÿØÿß ¬´ÿ¶???ÿ™ ???ÿ™?ÿ≤??ÿ±? ¬ª ?ÿß??ÿØÿß ÿ¶?? - ÿ≥????? ??ÿ≥ÿßÿ®??? ÿ¶?ÿ±???ÿßÿ¥ÿ™?ÿ±ÿØ?? . ???ÿ≥?ÿ™???ÿ≤ Ÿæ?ÿ±ÿ≤??ÿ™??ÿ±???ÿ≤?? ÿ¶??ÿ∫?ÿ± ÿ™???ÿØÿß ÿ≥?ÿ≤??ÿ¥?? ÿ±?ÿ∫ÿ®?ÿ™???ÿØ?ÿ±?ÿ¥ ? ÿ¶ÿß?ÿß ÿ™??ÿ∫ÿß ÿ®??ÿ∫ÿß? ??⁄æ?ÿ®ÿ®?ÿ™??? ??⁄≠??ÿ±?ÿßÿ¥ÿ™?ÿ±?ÿ¥ . ÿ®? ??ÿ≥ÿßÿ®???⁄Ø? ÿØ???ÿß??⁄≠ ⁄æ?ÿ±?ÿß?ÿ≥? ÿ¨ÿß??ÿßÿ±ÿØÿß ?ÿßÿ¥ÿß?ÿßÿ™?ÿß? ÿ®ÿßÿ±??? ÿ¶??ÿ∫?ÿ± ÿ¶?ÿ≥??ÿ±??ÿ±? ÿ®??ÿß?ÿß? ?ÿßÿ™??ÿ¥ÿß?ÿß?ÿØ? . ??ÿ≥ÿßÿ®???⁄Ø? ?ÿßÿ™?ÿßÿ¥????

763,Stage Et Concours Internationaux !,"Created March 6, 2020",Competitions & Pageants,"$7,500 ","$3,260 ",36,17,36,"Bonjour ? tous, Comme vous le savez peut-√™tre, j'ai depuis plusieurs ann√©es le grand d√©sir de me lancer ? l'international comme pianiste concertiste. Pour ce faire, je dois participer ? des concours internationaux et ? des stages. En avril prochain, j'ai la chance d'avoir √©t√© pris au concours international In Musica ? Rome. Je dois donc me rendre dans cette ville pour d√©buter mon p√©riple en avril prochain. Ensuite, j'ai la grande chance d'avoir √©t√© accept√© par madame Marie-Josephe Jude pour prendre des cours particulier ? Paris. Madame Jude est une grabde p√©dagogue enseignante au conservatoire national sup√©rieur de Paris.

Not only that, but Cam is the youngest person ever to receive it, as well as the first African American winner of the award and the first recipient with autism. Though Cam works in customer service full-time, he won this award on his incredible dedication to making science careers more accessible to all walks of life.? His regular volunteering at the Fernbank Science Center has become a mainstay of the museum's educational outreach for children and families.Cam is a dedicated self-taught Paleontologist, and though he is not in college, he frequently accompanies on college field excursions due to the mentor stance many professional paleontologists have taken towards him. It is uncommon to find someone so young and such an expert.Despite having an option to present his impressive knowlegde at GSA, Cam again made his work about accessibility with his Research poster titled ""Time Scavengers: Social media outreach allows for effective communication of geoscience education.""It will cost $2200 for Cam and his mom, Rhonda, to attend the ceremony at Mid-America Paleo Society in Iowa City. If we all pitch in, we can fly them from Georgia to Iowa, and Cam can receive his award and ceremony in person. For someone to have achieved and contributed so much this early in life despite every obstacle that has come his way, it's only fitting that Cam should be present at his own ceremony. We all appreciate everything Cam has done for the field, now it's our turn to do something for him!Read more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything I?ôve done from last summer to this point has been focused on one thing, returning to the World Championships. I figured with that goal in mind, other good things would happen along the way. It?ôs taken a tremendous amount of hard work, perseverance and support from family, teammates, friends, and the cycling community to position me for the level of success I?ôve experienced so far. So I?ôm happy to report that based on my performance throughout the season, culminating with my win at the Pan American Championships, I?ôve again been selected to represent the U.S. at the CX World Championships in Dubendorf, Switzerland.While this is an amazing opportunity on it?ôs own, this year I?ôll also have the opportunity to spend most of December through CX Worlds in February racing and training in Europe. Last year I missed out on the December block of racing and some of my favorite races which include the Namur and Zolder World Cups. But this year, a few days after I return from CX Nationals I?ôll depart for Belgium with the rest of my team to race the Kerstperiode between Christmas and New Years, which includes Namur, Zolder and several other local C 1/2 CX races. If that wasn?ôt cool enough, after 2 weeks of racing in Belgium I?ôll be headed down to Malaga, Spain to train in some nice weather for 2 weeks, which I am really excited about. Then from Spain I?ôll be flying back up to race two more World Cups in France and the Netherlands and then on to the World Championships in Dubendorf Switzerland.Over the course of 7 weeks I?ôll travel to 5 European countries, race in numeros C1 races, 4 World Cups, and CX Worlds. That brings me to the point of this campaign. This campaign is to raise money to offset some of the costs that I?ôll incur racing, training, traveling and transporting all my race equipment to Europe.This is going to be an amazing experience and I just hope it isn?ôt all a blur. For the benefit of all those following at home, feel free to give me a follow me on instagram @andrew.strohmeyer where I plan to capture and share my trip and experiences as I race and travel across Europe.

As you can imagine, this was a very difficult decision to make as it does not change the hours of work and financial load our exhibitors are continuing to put into their projects. Our youth work very hard preparing their animals and agricultural mechanics projects and are disappointed that they do not get the chance to show them this year. For most of these kids, the Denton County Youth Fair is a special time to not only show their projects but to enjoy the fellowship and spirit that can only be found at the county show.This year we had over 400 exhibitors and their projects that would have exhibited during this week competing for the 190 coveted Auction lots. Although there will be no formal sale, we are asking our past contributors to consider still allocating the funds you have spent in the past purchasing at our sale so that we may be able to relieve some of the financial burdens that are affecting these kids. The money collected will be divided amongst the youth across the county to help them offset their project expenses from this year. It is more important than ever that we enable our youth to be active in the agricultural industry. The future of our dinner table and so much more depends on the interests we are fostering today.As always, any contributions collected will be tax-deductible. We truly appreciate you being a continued supporter of the time-honored Denton County Youth Fair that has been supporting youth in agriculture since 1975.

My dream is to become a professional motocross/supercross racer. My passion for motocross started when I was only 2 1/2 years old and that was when I got my first dirt bike. It wasn't until I turned 5 that I was introduced to racing and have been racing ever since. My first big achievement was to participate in one of the biggest Motocross events in the State of California in Mammoth, CA. The excitement of the race, where I had the opportunity to race side by side with ridder much more experienced than I was, the adrenaline rushing though my whole body, the thrill of riding, and the emotions behind being part of such a unique sport, made my passion for dirt biking grow even more. The race environment, challenges that I continue to face and the new goals that I set for myself after every race kept me going stronger and stronger, even in the midst of many adversities.My father is my biggest fan and I am forever grateful for all the sacrifices he has made so I can pursue my dream. My father is my wingman, my mechanic, my transportation coordinator, my paramedic when I get hurt, my motivator, the single most important contributor to my career; but behind of all these, he is a good dad. And being the dad that he is, we end up making a deal. I can continue racing if I bring good school grades. I am proud to say that I will be going into 10th?grade with a GPA of 4.25In the past 10 years of racing, I have faced many challenges including injury and financial difficulties. Once I had to take almost a year off of racing due to the cost of training fees, maintenance and repairs, not to mention that I have just finished healing up from an ACL reconstruction surgery last year. Presently, I am feeling the best I have ever felt, especially when I am riding on my motocross.?Recently I placed 3rd and 4th in the area qualifiers which qualified me for the regional; and at the regionals, I got a 1st and 2nd in two different categories, giving me 2 spots in the biggest amateur race in the United States - The Loretta Lynn?ôs Ranch, in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee which will take place from August 3rd to the 8th, 2020.My father and I will be driving from California to Tennessee for the biggest challenge of my life. I am preparing myself physically and emotionally so I can put the performance that can potentially rocket me into the view of big time sponsors. All the biggest names and sponsors of the sport will be there, and this could be my break. We are also preparing ourselves for the trip and need your support to meet all the expenses with this trip like spare parts, riding gear, hotels, meals, practice fees, gasoline, and unexpected things that may happen along the way. I am going to be competing with kids whose parents are able to invest in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. As you all know, I come from a humble household and simply cannot compete at this level. I am counting on my talent, skills and dedication, and with a little help, I will succeed.I would be extremely grateful and humbled if you partner with me helping me to get one step closer to achieving my dream. Being able to go means everything to me. I have been putting a lot of work and effort so I can perform well on this event, and with your support, I will be even more motivated.

808,OU Rocket Student Team Spaceport America Cup 2020,"Created January 9, 2020",Competitions & Pageants,"¬£2,150","¬£7,000 ",18,64,18,"Who are we? We are the Open University Rocket Student Team designing and building a rocket for participating in Spaceport America Cup 2020 competition. Team members are from across the Open University student body, from undergraduate to PhD students, all aiming to broaden our horizons, learn new skills, and promote space technology and launch in the UK. Previously, the team has participated in Spaceport America Cup 2019 and several team members have experience with building a rover for international student rover competitions. The competition The Spaceport America Cup is the largest and most competitive intercollegiate rocketry competition in the world held at Spaceport America in New Mexico, USA. The competition has several categories; from targets of 10000 feet in altitude to 30000 feet, and solid, hybrid/liquid motor and student developed rocket fuel classes.?In the 2019 competition, we were one of over 100 student teams and one of 4 UK teams, competing against the likes of Stanford and UCLA. Our rocket placed 38th overall and came in at 19th in the 10000 feet all propulsion types category. A great achievement for the team's first year!In 2020, we are one of the 150 teams selected for the competition out of over 200 applicants. Due to a successful first year and the experience the team gained, we plan to once again enter the 10000 feet category but with designs to reach for the 30000 feet category if our campaign target is exceeded. Why rockets? Over the next decade the UK is expanding its launch capabilities with a new vertical launch site in Sutherland and two horizontal launch sites in Newquay and Glasgow Prestwick. Space is opening up and is no longer only for big government agencies such as NASA.? This is a great opportunity for UK business to flourish and expand within and beyond the space sector, with space applications already currently supporting other areas such as telecommunications, international development and weather forecasting. We hope to be a part of promoting launch in the UK on an international stage, using the rocket as a tool for learning about launch operations so that these skills could be applied to the benefit of UK launch services. Exciting and innovative scientific experiments can be performed with rockets, collecting hugely impactful data for many fields. The plan for our rocket is to house a 3U CubeSat containing two proof-of-concept experiments. The first package is an astrophysics experiment monitoring the cosmic ray interactions and the second package will be an astrobiology experiment investigating the effects of high G forces on soil samples. The goal of the first package is to support the development of missions looking into the solar system's space magnetic and radiation environment's effects on supporting life. The second package seeks to support future lander missions investigating the surface of planetary bodies and their ability to support life, eventually returning samples to Earth for examination.?With rockets being a key part of the space industry and widely supporting scientific experimentation, we are keen to be involved and promote their use within the UK.Houston, we have a problem! A large proportion of our fundraising target is towards sourcing parts and building the rocket systems; including its payload, flight computers and propulsion. Your donations will also help the team cover the costs of entry to the competition and shipping the rocket to the USA. The funds will be withdrawn by the co-team lead, Rob, into a dedicated bank account set up for the OU student rocket team. We plan to be fully transparent with where your donations go, updating the website with our expenditures (OU Planetary Robotics Student Team website) so you can see how your support has helped the team achieve its goal.?Current budget plan¬£523 - 98 mm motor casing¬£610 - Competition propellant?¬£1000 - Materials for airframe¬£500 - Flight electronics x2 (primary and redundancy), GPS system and payload materials¬£500 - Testing (including a smaller test launch propellant)?¬£1905.86 - Competition entry for 4 team members and insurance ($1500 for insurance, $200 entry fee, $700 team entry and $50 per team member attending competition)¬£250 - Vehicle hire for transporting rocket to launch site¬£1500 - Shipping rocket to and from the USAny excess funds raised will be put towards the 30000 feet design and helping the team cover their travel and accommodation expenses.Prepare for lift off in 3... 2... 1...

We hope you find our mini-story inspiring as much as these kids have been inspired by the camaraderie and learning they have had thus far.In late 2017, a small group of students in grades 8 to 10 decided to get together and create a robotics team to compete in a FIRST Robotics Competition. Our team, Iris Robotics, was formed, and after six intense weeks of planning, building, and lots of hard work, we had built a robot and were headed off to Victoria to compete. To our surprise, as this was the team's first competition, we won! Iris Robotics became the 2018 Canadian Pacific Regional Champions.? As a result, we traveled to the World Championships in Houston, Texas in April 2018. Our experiences at Worlds? helped inspire us to continue building robots, learning about science and technology, and connecting to other like-minded students. We have grown and learned immensely since that first year. We are now a team of 26 boys and girls and hope to once again take on the world.In 2019, we participated in two competitions for Operation Deep Space: once again in Victoria and at the 'Girls Generation' kickoff event in? Maple Valley, Washington. This year, we are fundraising for the same? two tournaments --? but we also have our sites clearly set?

She has had a tough time with peer relationships and school. In the past year, we have had our transmission go out in the van, the heat went out in the house, refrigerator died before Christmas, I was hospitalized with kidney stones, and in September she broke her leg (tibia). Minaugh was a trooper though. She and her broken leg went to all the cheer practices and learned the routine by on the sideline, she never complained, kept a positive attitude and was at the preview for her team and competitions cheering them on even though she couldn't compete. She couldn't ride the bus, do steps, and had to sleep on the floor because she couldn't climb her bed ladder. She got her cast off and slowly is strengthening her leg and she jumped right back in with her team and they won a bid to the D2 Summit. Her coach has said getting this bid is ""like being struck by lightning.""?We just can't come up with the money fast enough no matter how much I work but her attitude, spirit, dedication, to her team and even at school just seems like telling her she can't go would be a punishment when she has been so great.

We don't have family that can help and when I was in the hospital she missed school because I couldn't get her there but she was the best nurse ever. We are very close and even though she is a tween she is just such a great kid.

Those of us in the arts community and those of us who are close to the arts community know the financial pressures that have long been increasing for those in the arts - especially for artists of color.??Seattle has so far been the city hardest hit by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This scary and tragic? time has a lot of people staying close to home in order to try to help prevent the spread of this virus that can be devastating to our elderly, disabled, and medically compromised friends and neighbors.??The widespread cancellation of group events has had a disproportionate impact on the Seattle arts community - especially those who rely on gigs to pay their bills. Creatives are people whose very existence relies on what they create and people being able to access their work. Musicians, DJ?ôs, independent chefs, caterers, actors, directors, writers, spoken word artists, teaching artists, all of these peoples jobs rely on people showing up for events but events are being canceled.?I know that so far every speaking engagement I had for the next month has been cancelled or postponed, and I?ôm in the very rare and privileged position to be able to weather this financially. Many are not.? We?ôre seeing canceled events through the end of this month and it's probably going to continue to grow. A large percentage of artists supplement their incomes with part time jobs often in the service industry which is another industry that is being hit hard.?So if you love Seattle art and the Seattle arts community, and you have the resources to, please consider pitching in to our relief fund. If you are familiar with similar fundraisers I?ôve done in the past (like for last year?ôs snowpocalypse), you know that this money goes directly to people in the Seattle area in need.This fund is aimed at helping those in the greater Seattle arts community who have been financially impacted by cancellations due to COVID-19. Depending on funding levels and amount of requests, priority may given to artists from communities that have been historically and systemically economically disadvanted in the Seattle Area: BIPOC artists, transgender & nonbinary artists, and disabled artists - but we will try to help as many artists with need in Seattle as we can as long as we have funds and are not currently turning away any Seattle Area artists who meet the simple criteria (living in the Seattle area, have gig/event/work cancellation in the arts, have fully completed the application). We will basically keep going until we run out of money or this crisis ends - whichever comes sooner.Where your funds go: 100% of these funds will go to artists who have lost income due to cancellations and work stoppage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is emergency funding to help artists in need with rent, food, utilities, and medical needs. The amount given to each artist is determined based on how many funds we receive, how much artists have lost due to cancellations, and how many artists apply. We use these factors to calculate what percentage of each individual request we can pay each artist. We are currently giving a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $1000 to each individual artist.?How Funds will get to Artists: We will send funds to the mailing address, PayPal or Zelle indicated in the application. We've partnered with LANGSTON Seattle (?https://www.facebook.com/LangstonSeattle/ ) ?to send out payments in a timely and organized matter and to serve as an accountability and oversight partner. Langston is a 501c3 organizaton, and if you are interested in making a larger, tax-deductable donation to our fund, please use this link?( https://www.langstonseattle.org/donate/ ) to donate directly to LANGSTON and put ""Seattle Artists Relief Fund"" or ""SARF"" in the notes. You can also mail a?paper check directly to LANGSTON at (104 17th Ave S, Seattle, WA 98144). Checks should be made out to ""LANGSTON"" with ""Seattle Artists Relief Fund"" or ""SARF"" in the memo line.?We have suspended applications for funds as of now, in order to make sure we can meet the needs of the 1,700 people who have already applied for assistance. We are actively working to be able to meet these needs and raise enough to be able to open applications again.?If you are an artist in need of funds, we have a waiting list you can join here?.We can get through this together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But Loppen is threatened with closure by January 1st 2021.In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to shut down our venue. The situation comes in the wake of a refusal to grant operating funds from the State Arts Committee and an expired financial support agreement with the City of Copenhagen by the end of 2020. Consequently, we do not know when we can open again. Even with governments current support packages the situation looks dire. With commitments to our staff, our volunteers and our fixed expenses, keeping the doors closed costs us over 40.000 dkk a month.To ensure that our volunteers, employees, musicians and audiences have a place to return to, and to ensure that we can continue to offer concerts with the latest, best and most interesting live acts in many years to come, we have launched a crowdfund to help with some of the costs.As the amount suggests, we need more financial help than we can handle on our own.

831,Save Port Townsend's Rose Theatre,"Created September 2, 2020","Creative Arts, Music & Film","$187,775 ","$160,00",1.6K,5.5K,1.6K,"?úOld theatres are irreplaceable...I think a town?ôs old theatres are the sanctuary of its dreams.??- Roger EbertOn March 15th the historic Rose Theatre in Port Townsend, WA shut its doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no re-opening date in sight. There is no additional federal funding. Without help the Rose Theatre will remain closed forever.Why GoFundMe?Since mid-March we have been able to cover fixed expenses with savings, 3 loans, 1 federal grant, 4 movie theater grants, temporary rent abatement, donations, movie streaming, and gift card, membership and popcorn sales. But it's not enough. (Our federal PPP loan application was denied). This GoFundMe goal would sustain us for six months.Our StoryThe Rose opened in 1907 as a vaudeville house; it has seen the transition from silent film to talkies, and from Technicolor to digital projection. Located in the heart Port Townsend's National Historic District, it serves as one of the major cultural hubs of the Olympic Peninsula, offering a wide variety of independent, classic, foreign and Hollywood films, in addition to simulcasts from New York's Metropolitan Opera, Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet and plays from the National Theatre of London; as well as an annual dance film festival and arts film series. It also serves as the hub for the annual Port Townsend Film Festival.With its three screens, including the intimate Starlight Room, the Rose brings stories from around the globe to its little corner of the world. Every film is personally introduced; you'll find local cider, beer and kombucha on tap, not to mention popcorn with real butter. (More about the Rose here and here?and here and here?and here ).?What Will Donations Be Used For?Funds from this campaign will directly cover fixed monthly expenses - rent, insurance, utilities, phone, internet, accounting, bookkeeping, security, plus wages for three remaining employees. We don't know how long this state-mandated closure will last; our current fundraising goal would cover expenses until February 2021.Why Can't The Rose Open to Partial Audiences?Jefferson County, WA remains in Phase 2 of the state's phased re-opening for businesses. With Phase 3, movie theaters will be allowed to operate, but only at 25% capacity. Between all 3 of our screens, even a ""sell out"" would equal only 69 people. Operating expenses would exceed income. It's a no-win scenario. We cannot open until we can comfortably and safely invite audiences in with at least 50% capacity. We love our community and staff and will only open when it is safe and advisable.? It is very possible that we may not re-open until 2021....But Do Movie Theaters Even Matter Anymore?There are all kinds of ways to experience art, but we believe sometimes you should enjoy it collectively. The Rose is more than just a movie theater: it is a nexus for the Port Townsend community. We have employed nearly 300 local residents since we renovated and re-opened in 1992. We have hosted weddings, lectures, recitals, memorials, concerts and more. Our popcorn is a frequent dinner for the denizens of P.T. - even if they're not seeing the show. Movies today are viewed on screens of all sizes (and you can stream some of ours at home!), but there is a certain movie magic that can only be experienced as the directors/writers/actors/editors intended it - on the big screen and shared with others. We think the Rose still matters, and hope you do too.Other Ways to Help?-Stream movies via www.rosetheatre.com! Not only is there a curated selection of excellent independent fare, updated weekly, but half of every ticket directly supports the theatre. You can stream from anywhere!-Share this campaign with your friends.-We're currently open every Saturday, selling popcorn from 2:00 - 5:00 at 235 Taylor Street, and would love to say hello.Who We AreThe Rose is a family-owned business. In 1992 Rocky Friedman re-opened the darkened cinema after building owner and contractor Phil Johnson did a meticulous restoration. His daughter, who began tearing tickets when she was 12, assists with the business from her home in New York, where she works as an actress. We have a spectacular staff, some of whom have been with us for over 10 years, and all of us thank you from the bottom of our celluloid hearts for your support.?What's NextSince we began streaming movies on our website this spring, we've developed a plan to create a fully integrated online film library, with the same thoughtful curation you'll find on our screens, but available to audiences everywhere. We're hoping to provide a seamless viewing experience, with unique film categories and discounts for our members. Stay tuned for updates.Port Townsend is known as ""The City of Dreams"" and by contributing to this fund, you will directly aid in preserving the sanctuary of those dreams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TBS was founded by Joseph Cuillier III and Shani Peters in 2016. With socially engaged artists, designers, and educators working at the intersections of K-12/university teaching, art, design, and activism, all TBS programming is structured around our core principles of Black Love, self-determination, and wellness.??IMPACT: Since 2016,? we have served over 400 students, facilitated over 100 workshops and classes, produced three Black Love Fests , collaborated with more than 40 professional artists, trained and employed 16 design apprentices, and partnered with over 50 organizations.??SCHOOLHOUSE: With this foundation of programmatic success, we are now working towards our ultimate goal to move back to Joseph?ôs hometown and build a Black Art School in New Orleans' 7th Ward.??SOCIALLY RELEVANT EDUCATION: What does it look like to center Black love in a learning space? We relate to our students as extended family and not a social problem to be corrected.? All of our programs are customized for each group we engage. Everything we do is ultimately about honoring our ancestors who loved us so much that they gave us everything we need. It's in their art, it's in their writings, and in our bodies.???ECOSYSTEM/HYBRIDITY: Over time, we?ôve established the school in this 3-part ecosystem: an art school, festival, and youth-staffed design firm.??- School -The school is based on a workshop model designed to teach critical thinking and civic engagement through art making. After answering the questions ?úWhat do you love about your community???and ?úWhat do you want to change about your community???participants address a community issue through art. We start with knowledge of self and love of community.??- Studio -The Black School: Studio is an art and design firm in which we train youth in paid apprenticeships to execute real-world client work with the long-term intention of self-sustaining programming through earned revenue. This program not only prepares Black and Brown youth for practical, well paying creative careers, but it also equips them with the political consciousness/activist tactics to become change makers. ??- Festival -Black Love Fest is a free one-day celebration that allows us to publicly share students' artworks back with the community. It includes art exhibits, music performances, installations by professional artists, food, vendors and workshops. The festival demonstrates on a large scale the vision of the world we want to live in, a world centered on Black love.?2 ) Where & WhyFAMILY LEGACYIt?ôs our own families histories which actually grounds us in this work. Shani?ôs father taught Black Studies in Michigan for 50 years and has a legacy of hundreds of students who he impacted deeply. After returning to New Orleans from WWII, Joseph?ôs grandfather, Joseph Cuillier Sr. earned his bachelor's in education from HBCU Xavier University back when the city didn?ôt even hire Black teachers. Years later in 1989, Lincoln High, previously ?úRosenwald"" High, where he taught and became principal, was actually renamed in his honor.?HISTORICAL CONTEXTSome of the history we think of the most in terms of building a home for school is the legacy of Booker T. Washington. He emerged from emancipation with the belief that education would be the building blocks for Black folks to construct better lives. With the help of wealthy philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, they built 5,000 Black schoolhouses across the South, always in collaboration with the local communities. Our family history and its direct connection to the legacy of Black school building as a means for self liberation inspires The Black School to move from its current mobile structure to an independent Black institution of its own. We will do this by building a 21st century schoolhouse as a community center serving New Orleans' 7th Ward and surrounding areas. This structure will be complete with workshop spaces, a media lab to house TBS: Studio, a gallery, a reading/meditation room, a kitchen, an artist-in-residence space, and an open access community garden. Imagine being in a school designed by artists, where the school is the artwork and the classrooms feel more like meditation spaces than the prisons so many of our schools are built like today.?PARTNERSWe started planning our move from NYC to New Orleans about 4 years ago when we found out we were pregnant with our daughter. We were? already making frequent trips to see family, and the idea to establish our own building flowed from there. We?ôve already started programming with Xavier University and we have official plans to partner with the New Orleans African American Museum, the New Orleans Museum of Art, The Community Book Center, and Antenna. We are in contact with many more New Orleans based artists, educators, and organizers, and look forward to establishing a broad network of partnerships as we complete our transition to the City.3 ) What We NeedPHASE 1:?For Phase 1, we need to raise the first $60K to purchase land, conduct participatory design workshops with local partners and community members, and produce architectural drawings in collaboration with a New Orleans-based Black architects Bryan C. Lee Jr.? and Whawn Allen?,? and internationally recognized sustainable architecture firm, LOT-EK?. We'll use new architectural technologies like modularity and upcycling to build a working prototype for promoting community-built Black radical learning spaces, as well as, low-cost solutions for housing displacement. In the legacy of the Booker T?ôs schools, we want to publish our building plans to promote the creation of more spaces like ours.PHASE 2:For Phase 2, we need to raise an additional $150K for the permits, fees, building materials, construction.PHASE 3:For Phase 3, we need to raise the last $100k for equipment, early programming, like furniture design workshops, and staffing. In addition to grants and partnerships, revenue from our student staffed design firm and sales from a growing suite of learning tools, merchandise, and art, will sustain our programming beyond the build.CALL TO ACTIONDo you want to be a part of a radical shift in education and support Black institution building?

PANArt, the swiss company that created the Hang, claims to have copyright on the shape and the defining aspects of the instrument and wants to declare handpans illegal copies. Their claim states that the Hang is not primarily a musical instrument, but a piece of ?òfine art??and therefore eligible for copyright protection. Musical instruments are usually not protected under copyright.If this claim stands uncontested, it will have far-reaching consequences for the handpan world. Makers could be forbidden from creating handpans as we know them. It would be impossible to purchase handpans in their current form within the affected countries. In the worst case scenario this could also affect the right to public display through live concerts, videos, workshops, etc.Handpan Community United, a non-profit organisation, was created to contest PANArt?ôs copyright claim and protect the future existence of the handpan instrument. HCU hired the high profile international law firm Bird & Bird, as it is of utmost importance to have the best lawyers available to ensure our goal. From recent events, it is clear PANArt has spared no expenses on their own legal representation.The seriousness of adequately funding and defending this cause cannot be underestimated. PANArt?ôs recent Cease & Desist, warning letters and court proceedings against shops in Germany (World of Handpans and Yatao Shop) and a maker/material provider from the Netherlands (Ayasa Instruments) clearly show what is at stake. This is just the beginning...The funds required to defend this instrument are substantial. However, the effect on our lives will be even greater if the handpan instrument ceases to exist as we know it. A serious and well-defended response requires expertise and funding if we are to effectively protect the handpan industry from the very real threat of being shut-down. The court procedures can potentially last several years and the current estimate of legal costs from Bird & Bird from start to finish is circa 250,000 Euro.All raised funds will be placed in the trust account of HCU, a registered non-profit organisation, to be used only for purposes as defined in the HCU Mission Statement.

Over the subsequent 12 years, it has become a centerpiece of downtown Alameda and a source of pride for all Alamedans.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Theatre has been entirely shut down since March. Since then, the ownership has utilized all of the Federal and local government support available to maintain the facility. Those funds are now running out and with no re-opening timeframe being discussed for theatres, it?ôs time for the community to rally to support this iconic Alameda landmark.Even though the Theatre is closed, bills like utilities, insurance, and basic maintenance do not stop: It takes $25,000 per month just to sustain the business until it can re-open.Please help our beloved Theatre make it through these unprecedented times!Statement from the Conner Family:I moved? my family to this amazing Island City in 2006 to build the Alameda Cineplex and renovate and re-open the landmark Historic Alameda Theatre.?

If you?ôre a lover of the arts, please consider contributing directly to the individuals who devote their lives to creating for our city.Our equity lens:We recognize the inequity inherent in our communities - globally, nationally, locally, and often especially in the arts. Even in times of stability , many working artists are able to pursue their careers with the help of family wealth, the support of a partner, or work in other fields, and many benefit from other social privileges? connected to race, gender, sexuality, size, ability, citizenship status, and more. As Ijeoma Oluo, organizer of the Seattle Artists Relief Fund, writes, some of us are in ?úthe rare and privileged position to be able to weather this [crisis] financially. Many are not.?ùWe recognize that government agencies, institutions, and non-profits often do not or are not able to prioritize those whom inequity affects most on a daily basis, even outside times of crisis. As such, we prioritize artists who are Black, Indigenous, People of Color, Queer, Trans+, Non-Binary, and Disabled, but will endeavor to support as many Chicago artists as possible.??Our fiscal sponsor:?We're proud to be sponsored by Soham Dance Space, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit.

Launching careers in music, comedy, and spoken word, the club has been a mainstay in the entertainment industry and has come to be an important part of the fabric that makes Greenwich Village such a vital part of NYC lore and history. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Bitter End, like many live venues in NYC, is facing tremendous financial struggle as we try to reopen our doors. We are now reaching out to the world to help us keep this iconic music club alive. We have provided the stage and environment that has helped countless entertainers hone their crafts. From Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, John Prine and Lady Gaga, to Billy Crystal, George Carlin, and Jon Stewart, we have had countless entertainers begin their careers with us who have then gone on to become great performers and pillars in their fields. Thousands of artists have graced our stage over the past six decades. Nurturing the entertainment community has always been our goal and we hope to continue this tradition and add to this long list of successes. The rich history contained within her walls is unparalleled, and to see the doors shut forever would be a shame and a tragedy. Make no mistake, The Bitter End is still a NYC music Mecca. It?ôs a place where new and established artists alike nurture, develop, and showcase their acts. It?ôs a place where top national musicians can hold weekly jams, and where up and coming musicians are discovered. It?ôs a place where singers, songwriters, comedians, rappers, and poets can enjoy a weekly open mic. It?ôs a gathering place for NYC?ôs top working artists to hang out before or after a gig for a drink, as well as watch their colleagues perform. It?ôs a place where you, music lovers, are invited to witness this magic. It?ôs a place that has survived decades of change and disaster because it deserved to, and still  deserves to, just as much today as it ever did. We all want to return to a world as close to normal as it was before. A world without the Bitter End just doesn?ôt seem normal at all to us who have been lucky enough to work here. We hope it doesn?ôt seem normal to you, either. Most of you have spent the past months giving while you weren?ôt getting, and it isn't easy to ask for help like this in any circumstance.

As is well known, the political revolution in Oromia was sparked and led by the young men and women of the qubee generation, likewise, Kello Media was created and led by a group of dedicated Oromo youth in the diaspora. In a little over a year, we have worked to realize that vision and become an inclusive, pacesetting platform for the people of Oromia and beyond. We have strived to bring our people something new that they will not see on other media platforms while at the same time never compromising on our Oromummaa.It has always been our view that Kello Media will be one of the gifts that the qeerroo of the Qubee generation will leave behind for Oromia and her people. Our people?ôs reception has been overwhelmingly positive and we have only made it this far due to their consistent and unyielding moral support. We have now been able to begin satellite broadcasts to Oromia, increase our output capacity, improve our technology and build a home-based staff.But just as we have reached this stage, we are now seeing an attack on free media in Oromia, some of which has been directed at us through the Ethiopian government?ôs propaganda wing on social media. As such, we are taking measures to expand and secure Kello Media to take it into a position that will ensure that our people?ôs free access to our content cannot be hindered. This involves securing a backup satellite and expanding our staff in Oromia. As this operation is urgent and costly, we are turning to our diaspora community to aid us financially.We are confident that our community will continue in its steadfast and strong support of Kello Media.

L√§ka, inte f√∂r att de √§r trasiga, utan f√∂r att finna tr√∂st i det som k√§nns sv√•rt. Denna diktsamling har varit ett p√•g√•ende arbete f√∂r mig under flera √•r men nu, d√• det kollektiva lidandet √§r extra p√•tagligt i v√§rden, k√§nde jag en stark dragning att dela den.Slutgiltigt bokomslag - design av Nikki Shmidt?V√•ra inre barn svarar an reaktivt p√• undermedvetna r√§dslor, trauman och ned√§rvda beteendem√∂nster och d√• blir denna bok en tr√∂sterik v√§gledare. Boken riktar str√•lkastaren mot skuggorna som finns inom oss alla s√• att vi v√•gar n√§rma oss det som tidigare varit dolt. Den inf√∂rlivar mod att se bortom det som inte s√§gs, hantera det som k√§nns o√∂vervinnerligt sv√•rt eller m√∂ta det man inte v√•gar se. V√§gen mot l√§kande kan appliceras p√• m√•nga delar av v√•ra liv och l√§kande kan ibland visa sig p√• platser inom oss som vi inte ens visste var i behov av l√§kning.SUPPORTFrakt √§r inkluderat i alla summor.BOKENS UPPL?GGDiktsamlingen best√•r av strax √∂ver 90 haikus i bunden form.

Boken best√•r av ett intro och fem kapitel och den kan l√§sas fr√•n p√§rm till p√§rm som en hel process eller som frist√•ende delar. Detta s√• att du enkelt kan navigera och tillgodose dig precis det du beh√∂ver d√§r du befinner dig i livet f√∂r tillf√§llet.F√∂rnekelsen: Erk√§nn f√∂r dig sj√§lv att det finns f√∂rnekelse kring det som g√∂r ont.Sm√§rtan: V√•ga k√§nna det som g√∂r ont och lyft fram det i ljuset.Ilskan: Till√•t dig sj√§lv att k√§nna ilska, vrede och hat och l√§tta p√• skammen kring detta behov.F√∂rl√•telsen: V√§lj att f√∂rl√•ta b√•de dig sj√§lv och andra f√∂r att finna ro.L√§kandet: Hylla och lyft det arbete du lagt ner och se vilken outgrundlig styrka du b√§r p√•.VEM ?R JAG OCH VARF?R SKRIVER JAG DENNA BOK?Mitt namn √§r Victoria och jag √§r poet och copywriter.

Jag ser tillbaka p√• den perioden i mitt liv med st√∂rsta respekt d√• jag inser vilka enorma l√§rdomar som kommit ut i ljuset tack vare detta. I denna diktsamling har jag samlat alla sj√§lsliga guldkorn jag kommit √∂ver p√• v√§gen mot just l√§kande.

Keine Disco, kein Fussball, keine Studentenfutterparties, nur Bands.Nirgendwo sonst haben Publikum und K√ºnstler eine solche N√§he zueinander. Nirgendwo sonst trieft es so sch√∂n von der Decke, bei bestem Sound. Es ist einfach die sch√∂nste und lauteste Sauna Deutschlands.Unz√§hlige nationale, wie internationale K√ºnstler haben hier ihre ersten Shows gespielt: Rammstein, Slipknot, Oasis, No Doubt, Blink-182, Queens of the Stoneage, Avenged Sevenfold, Udo Lindenberg, 187 Strassenbande, Ray Garvey, RAF Camora, Mono Inc., Tocotronic, die Liste l√§sst sich beliebig verl√§ngern... Seit 1974 steht das LOGO f√ºr feinste Live-Musik. 2019 wurde der Club mit dem Applaus-Preis der Bundesregierung f√ºr ein ""kulturell herausragendes Musikprogramm"" ausgezeichnet. Nach 46 Jahren Rock'n'Roll ist das LOGO seit dem 12.03.20 wegen der Corona-Pandemie geschlossen.Jetzt steht der Club kurz vor der Pleite... 15.000??laufende Kosten im Monat, ohne Ums√§tze... Knapp 100.000??verbrannt seit dem Beginn der Pandemie...Rettungsschirmprogramme greifen nicht, da der Club die letzten Jahre gut gewirtschaftet hat und Geld auf dem Konto hatte.

Das Fehlen einer solchen Varianz im Leben ist deutlich sp√ºrbar und ich w√ºnsche mir f√ºr alle Beteiligten, dass wir nicht langfristig darauf verzichten m√ºssen.""Bina, Tresen: ""Das Logo und ich, eine lange Liebesgeschichte... Mal lagen wir uns trunken in den Armen, mal gab es wegen der tropfenden Decke eine kleine Krise. Es hat mich hofiert und mir die geilsten Abende Auge in Auge mit meinen Lieblingsbands beschert.

Ich hoffe, noch viel Zeit mit diesem lauten kleinen Schuppen verbringen zu d√ºrfen.""Chris, Booking: ""Das Logo ist seit √ºber 20 Jahren mein Leben. Unz√§hlige unfassbare Erinnerungen, als Fan, Musiker, Mitarbeiter und Familienmitglied. Morgens direkt aus dem QotSA-Tourbus zum Zivildienst... B√ºhnensecu im Vollabriss bei Slipknot... Oder einfach dieses unglaubliche Gef√ºhl, morgens nach einer geilen Show mit 400 gl√ºcklichen Menschen das letzte Bier mit Crew, Freunden und den letzten G√§sten an der Bar zu trinken. Mehr geht f√ºr mich nicht... Ohne w√§re ernsthaft √§tzend.""Milton, Ton: ""LOGO took me under their wing when i first moved to Germany almost ten years ago and when i was struggling to make it as a sound engineer.. Here they let me grow and flourish into the sound engineer i am today. In no other place of work have I ever felt such togetherness and friendship as i have in the Logo, it is simply astonishing and i have made so many friends in this place in the ten years i have been there. Not to mention that i get to mix some tremendous upcoming bands and that i get to meet and mix some of my heroes from the 80?ôs and 90?ôs. If Logo doesn?ôt survive this pandemic, I am not sure my sound engineering will either, it would just feel wrong to keep mixing.""Leia, Azubi: ""Im Logo kann ich so sein wie ich bin! Das gilt auch f√ºr alle anderen die sich, egal in welchem Kontext, im Logo wieder finden. Diese Diversit√§t und bunte Mischung an Charakteren macht f√ºr mich einen grossen Teil des ""Logo-Charmes"" und seiner einzigartigen Authentizit√§t aus. Ich vermisse die vielen verschiedenen Gesichter und die Geschichten die dahinter stecken.""Andrea, Tresen:? ""Das Logo ist f√ºr mich:- Niemals Arbeit auch wenn es hinterm Tresen mal wieder knackig ist, sondern immer ein Treffen mit Freunden.- Die besten Kollegen- Ein Ort zum Ankommen?- Ein Ort um in den Armen liegend, schwitzend und gl√ºcklich Bands zu sehen, √ºber die ich ohne meine Arbeit im Logo evtl nie gestolpert w√§re- Meine pers√∂nliche musikalische Weiterbildung?- das Lebenswerk von Ebi und allen √ºber die Jahre Mitwirkenden, und dies gilt es zu Erhalten.

Das LOGO ist f√ºr mich zu Hause, ein Platz voller unvergesslicher Momente und vor allem Familie. Es gibt keinen Ort an dem ich mehr Musikkultur erlebt habe, als dort.""Gunnar, Tresen: ""Das Logo ist f√ºr mich ein ein alter und zugleich rebellischer Rockschuppen, der seines gleichen sucht. Das Logo ist Ausbildungsst√§tte und ein geliebter Arbeitsplatz. Im Logo steckt soviel Musikgeschichte, wie in wohl keinem anderen kleinen Club. Dieses St√ºck Kultur muss bleiben.""Melissa, Tresen: ""Das Logo ist nicht nur ein Kult-Club, in dem gro?e K√ºnstler ihre ersten Schritte machten und sich Newcomer-Bands sofort zuhause f√ºhlen, das Logo ist ein Teil der Hamburger Geschichte! Ein Ort f√ºr jeden Live-Musik Liebhaber, in dem man immer durch das tolle Team gut gelaunt bedient wird und sich einfach wohl f√ºhlt. F√ºr mich ist das Logo viel mehr als Kultur, mehr als ein Ort um Spa? zu haben und gute live Musik zu erleben, das Logo ist Familie!

We are also very grateful to Lambeth Council for the hardship grant we have received and for those who have helped us by holding events. We are now getting ready to re-open the venue in a limited fashion, with no shows, cabaret or club nights, and this money will be used to help run The RVT during this time of massively reduced income. Although we have reached the target we set, we will leave the page up and running until we open on 4 July as there are outstanding donations which still have to be made.24 May 2020 - Start dateDuring the lockdown we have received many messages of support from performers, promoters and our loyal customers, many of whom have asked if they can donate to the upkeep and running costs and help to keep our much loved venue safe.The RVT is a family of talented artists, promoters, very loyal customers and invaluable staff.

We are still having to pay all our running costs, which are about ¬£25,000 a month while we are forced to remain closed, including rent to our landlord, they will not consider any change to the rent structure. When we do reopen it is likely to be with severe restrictions on numbers, which means our income will be greatly reduced going forward.Therefore we have decided to set up a Go Fund Me page so that people who want to and are able to make a contribution, can now do so.

Thirty percent of artists, performers and arts workers earn under the minimum wage already (https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/well-known-performers-and-actors-earn-less-than-minimum-wage-1.3757750?). Artists in Ireland are living with no safety net, working from gig to gig, event to event. The grim reality is that some are living in poverty with no security, no pensions, no sick leave, no parental leave and no means to plan for the future. The impact of this pandemic is particularly savage for artists in Ireland at this time.As venues, festivals, schools etc have closed, artists are finding that some or even all of their work in the coming weeks or even months has been cancelled or postponed without any kind of payment. This trend and its impact is likely to be felt well beyond the spring season. To make matters worse, a large percentage of artists supplement their incomes with part time jobs, often in the service industry, another industry that hit hard by this pandemic. Resources in the arts are stretched too thin across too many, with arts organisations and artists alike experiencing serious financial pressure.?We? have established a fund to provide financial relief to Irish artists who had guaranteed income that was lost due to COVID-19. Small grants of up to ??00 will be paid rapidly on a first-come, first-served basis to affected artists and groups.Donations will be accepted by individuals and corporations in order to replenish the fund and continue making payments to eligible artists in the queue.

As an organization we have no administrative costs, so this is a 100% direct donation.? Money will be dispersed based on the specific needs of each venue.? For some it will be used to help offset the cost of rent that many have been paying out of pocket with no performance revenue.? For others it will be used to prepare for reopening and the multitudes of safety protocol that mill need to be implemented.? Still others will need the money to pay their utility bills that haven't slowed down since mid March.? Point being, every donation is one step towards helping this community become whole again.??Think of some of your fondest memories. Think of where they happened. We?ôre willing to bet that at least one of them happened at a concert. Our industry is based around the idea of bringing people together for shared communal artistic experiences, and our industry is in real trouble. In March of this year the first cancellations came, and what at the time felt like a weekend of lost revenue has now turned in to a year of lost revenue. This has affected musicians, agents, managers, and fans in ways that are profound and direct, though at the center of it all independent venues have been affected in ways that are almost incalculable.Independent venues are rooms that don?ôt have the backing of a national or international conglomerate. They are owned by people that have a stake in the communities that they seek to serve. They come in all shapes and sizes. From Sun Tiki to The Apohadion to Blue, from SPACE Gallery to One Longfellow Square and all the way up to Port City Music Hall, the State Theatre and Thompson?ôs Point. We are an ecosystem that cannot operate individually and we understand that together we are stronger than one. Over the last ten years our venues have brought thousands of shows, bands, ideas and unique experiences to our city. Collectively, we are one of the biggest employers in Portland. We generate millions of dollars in both direct and indirect revenue and we brought credibility to a city that was once without much credibility in the touring industry. Bands that had never really thought about playing Portland are now automatically including Portland in their touring plans. Throughout the past several years, the biggest beneficiary of all of this was the fans. Portland has some of the best fans in existence. In turn, our venues always try to treat fans with the respect and dignity that they deserve. Our fans are recognized as the lifeblood that keeps venues, musicians, and the industry as a whole resilient day after day, year after year. Now our venues need you more than ever. If you value our venues as much as we value you, our fans, please donate whatever amount is comfortable for you. All donations will be pooled and distributed to Portland?ôs music venues based on metrics of need, capacity and operating costs. Any amount helps.We sincerely appreciate all of you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can you contribute to help us raise our finishing funds? We need between $144,000 and $160,000 to get to the finish line.Why does this matter?Before an explosive global uprising condemned the murder of George Floyd, there was a small town in Missouri that erupted in protest after the murder of Mike Brown Jr. As it was in Ferguson, so it has been again around the world: tanks in the streets, tear gas and rubber bullets fired at peaceful protesters, storefronts engulfed in flames, and everywhere the clear and courageous voices of people who can no longer tolerate the scourges of racism and police brutality. The scale of the uprising has grown, but the broken heart and defiant soul of the movement is the same. What can the world learn from a protest like this? And how can we begin to come together to create a new world in its aftermath?These difficult but important questions are explored in our paradigm-shifting, documentary film Ferguson Rises. Beyond the media sensationalism and simplistic narratives, Ferguson Rises presents diverse perspectives from a sometimes uneasy mix of people in Ferguson, a microcosm of the United States.?The lessons of Ferguson are more than just lessons around organizing and civil rights; they are lessons in building community and finding hope in the face of tragedy. These lessons can be instructive to this nation as it attempts to remedy and heal the deep divisions that stand in the way of our recognizing each other?ôs humanity.?What happened to Mike Brown Jr. happened to George Floyd, to Breonna Taylor, and happens every 28 hours to another African American at the hands of police, security guards, and vigilantes. More ""Fergusons"" will continue to happen unless we all stand up and do something to end the underlying conditions of racism and injustice that cause this.?As we march and pass legislation, let?ôs not forget the power of film to keep the message of justice alive, long after the streets are cleared.

Two and a half decades ago, skateboarding related charities were non-existent. Today, there are numerous non-profits giving back to skateboarding in many vital ways. One of the most important differences between now and then is that, 26 years ago, there was a clear division between old school and new school skateboarding. Now that wall of separation has followed the same path as the Berlin Wall, allowing for an unprecedented unification of skateboarders all over the globe. Great strides have been made for girls that skate as well as the acceptance of skate history and long overdue recognition for skateboarding?ôs pioneers and its artifacts. At the same time, the current generation of skateboarders is taking skateboarding to new heights, previously unimaginable. Skateboarding?is as diverse as the skateboarders that are addicted to it and the state of skate is strong. It has been the greatest honor to be part of the skate, surf, art and music family over the last quarter of a century and I just want to thank you all for the opportunity and for all of your support. I know these times are rough for everyone, so please know how much I believe in you. I hope you are staying safe and well out there and thank you for caring, sharing and contributing! Peace, love and respect always...============NOTE FROM DAN LEVY ??JUICE MAGAZINE ASSISTANT EDITOR AND MARKETING DIRECTOR============Terri Craft has been at the helm of Juice Magazine since founding it in 1993 and she has not wavered in her pursuit to preserve the cultural significance of our beloved arts through the ancient archiving format of talk story. Her unbelievable passion to keep Juice Magazine alive for over two and a half decades with no major investment is a testament to her all-in attitude and uncompromising loyalty to documenting skateboarding/music/art and surfing. Juice Magazine is more than paper and ink. It is a beacon of authenticity to skaters, musicians, artists and surfers all over the world. Over the years, Juice has grown into more than just a print magazine, and Terri, with her DIY attitude, figured it out by learning how to build a website, make merchandise, throw events, raise money for charities, help get skateparks built in NYC and Venice Beach and more, all while putting others before herself to keep the celebration of our culture alive. Terri is not one to ask for this type of help, however, after all she has done for all of us, we are asking for your assistance on her behalf. With your help, Juice Magazine will remain an independent voice, shining the light on those who deserve it, while remaining a forum of open and honest communication for us to share our love for skateboarding, music, art and surfing worldwide. Skateboarding is the family we choose and when you have family you can get through anything.?Juice Magazine now needs your help to keep music, surf, skate, art journalism and advocacy alive during this difficult time. The COVID-19 virus shuttered the Venice Beach Skatepark as well as live music and cultural events here in Venice: including many of our music venues, bars and restaurants; festivals and concerts; art shows and skateboarding events. The virus has also temporarily suspended events at our Venice Beach based location and our print edition of Juice Magazine is temporarily on hold until Barnes & Noble resumes accepting shipments of magazines, so our ability to stay alive is threatened. ?Your donation will help us to keep Juice Magazine up and running and help to keep our skateboarding, surfing, art, music advocacy alive and strong.?Please consider a donation, and thank you most gratefully!============QUOTES ABOUT JUICE...============Here are just a few words of kindness and encouragement that have kept us going over the years?¶‚ÄúJUICE has the Juice.

I?ôve witnessed first hand their unrelenting dedication to the skate, music, art and surf world. They are a pilLar to this community, ALWAYS giving. I know personally, that they live and breath, giving every single part of their existence, selflessly, to this community. I?ôve seen them hit really hard times, when life might be easier to just throw in the towel, but they?ôve never given up and they still keep giving back. Their intention behind it is 100 pure and old school and NOTHING less. I know most of us are hitting hard times ourselves, but if you feel any connection to this, and have a lil extra to help out, please do. We need to keep this magazine alive. When so much is changing in the world, not even talking about Covid, but technology and the internet is taking over, it feels good to hold this printed magazine in your hands, read thru the interviews and look at bitching photos. Next time you read an issue of Juice, know that there are a LOT of blood, sweat and tears that go into it. A whole lotta LOVE, too. I?ôve honestly never known anyone as dedicated to something as these two. Terri started this mag 26 years ago and she?ôs given everything she?ôs got to it. Literally everything.

You are the truth, the life and the hopeless skate-addicts lifeline to Utopia. Thanks again.????BARRY STRACHAN ??AUSTRALIA""Juice Magazine is arguably the very heart and soul of Venice, California. They have been documenting the skate, surf, and music scenes around the world since 1993, and a lot of the town's cool can be easily traced back to Juice. Publisher/Editor/Owner, Terri Craft, and Assistant Editor, Dan Levy, have been bringing everyone the Juice for over 26 years, and now it's time to return the favor... Juice Magazine is pretty much the Bible to so many in the skate world, not only in Venice, but around the world ... Venice just gets to call them our own. So many awesome times have originated with Juice ... from skate contests to ragers at the Juice headquarters, from epic art exhibitions like Beyond The Streets to little art shows in local galleries. From collaborations with the California Locos and Shepard Fairey (and a new print for Juice is coming very soon by Fairey in another effort to fundraise - how cool!) to showcasing the work of local and coming up artists - and bands and writers and everyone who gets and appreciates the Juice vibe... They were fundamental in helping to get the Venice Skatepark built, as well as getting the documentary about it made - Made In Venice is crucial viewing for anyone who cares about skating and/or Venice. We have already lost so much from this awful virus, don't let it happen to one of the very best things about Venice/the skate/surf/art/music world. I miss being in Venice so much right now, and the Juice family is one of the things I miss the very most. PLEASE let it still be there when I get back. PLEASE let us now have their back. One more time, you may donate HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH for helping to bring so many more awesome times to us all! You're awesome too. LONG LIVE JUICE!"" ?ì¬†CJ GRONNER - BLOGTOWN================JUICE HISTORY================Juice Magazine is dedicated to documenting the heart and soul of skateboarding, surfing, music, art?and culture. Through its print magazine, website, social media, skate contests, music events, art shows, Dogtown Chronicles, Alva Collection, Duty Now For the Future Series, Bones Brigade Chronicles, Mid-Atlantic Sound Surf & Skate Symposiums, Juice Surf Skate Culture Collection Shows, Five and Alive at Riverside, Venice Skatepark Contests, Guinness World Record Wall Ride, Juice Drop In Shows, Juice Live, Venice Skateboard Culture Experiences, fundraisers for charities and skateboarding events, and its commitment to help get a skatepark built in Venice, California and raise funds for Andy Kessler?ôs 108 Riverside Skatepark in New York City, NY, Juice has endeavored to support the surf/skate/music community worldwide for over a quarter of a century.?In 1993, in Wilmington, North Carolina, the first issue of Juice Magazine was created with a $500 start-up family loan. After receiving a Bachelor of Science in Marketing from UNC-Wilmington, Terri Craft saw the need for a magazine with extensive coverage of the burgeoning music, skate and surf scene. The music, surf, and skate combination soon grabbed hold of the marketplace and the Juice presence was established. After write-ups in Rolling Stone, Men?ôs Journal, Thrasher, TransWorld Business, TransWorld Skateboarding and Entrepreneur, Craft was even more encouraged to pursue her dream.?From the start, Juice has focused on unique content, and discovering unsung talent in the music, skate, art and surf communities while paying respect to its pioneers and innovators. With street teams spreading the word, Juice firmly ensconced itself as an essential periodical for the surf/skate/music audience and expanded its distribution to the entire East Coast. In addition, Juice launched the first Juice compilation CD, in 1995, and participated in numerous trade shows including SxSW, Surf Expo, Magic, and the CMJ Music Marathon, as well as the debut of the Warped Tour.In June 1996, Juice created its first annual music and sports conference, the Mid-Atlantic Sound Surf and Skate Symposium. M.A.S.S.S ??6 included over 100 bands, 30 pro skateboarders, an independent film festival, music seminars, and interactive Internet broadcasting by SonicNet, which attracted top music industry executives and over 7,000 attendees. ?In July of 1996, Juice Magazine launched a second Juice office in New York City, and immediately attracted over 80 freelancers nationwide. As a direct result, Juice strengthened its editorial voice and established new relationships with national advertisers. After expanding distribution, Juice witnessed immediate response as the national ad ratio increased from 20 to 50 percent. Juice also dove into one of the most challenging markets, New York City, and successfully progressed from a regional to a national publication with retailers across the country in 41 states, as skate legends, Jim Murphy and Andy Kessler, joined the Juice team as Skate Editors.In 1997, Juice hosted the second annual M.A.S.S.S. showcasing 175 bands, skateboarding demos, a fashion awards show, recording industry mentor sessions, surfing contests, a VW smash-up and dune buggy show and an additional outdoor stage. The Juice skateboarding street course and Juice vert ramp featured professional skateboarder Tony Hawk as well as over 40 other pro skaters.? As a result, attendance at M.A.S.S.S. 1997 sailed over the 10,000 mark. Sponsors, Pepsi-Cola, Miller Brewing and Eastern Skateboard Supply were extremely pleased, as was the community, as millions of dollars in hotel and restaurant revenues poured in for the week long event. In NYC, Dan Levy joined Juice as Assistant Editor and Ad Sales Director bringing expertise as a skateboarder and skatepark owner to the team.In 1998, planning began for Urban Phenomenon, a monumental music concert and skateboarding event, which took place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, site of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics. Juice was chosen to organize the skateboarding for this landmark occasion, gathering together over 110 of the world?ôs best pro skateboarders. The concert featured Run-DMC, Brand Nubian, 808 State and Mix Master Mike as well as the Red Bull vert ramp and became a launching ground for the Tony Hawk Pro Skater Video Game.?In September 1999, Juice Magazine expanded once again with a new office in the heart of multi-cultural and creative Venice, California, in order to more fully capture the advertising base on the West Coast. Due to this expansion, without additional staffing, the publishing schedule was modified from eight to four issues per year in order to continue to make the best magazine every time. Juice also stepped in to champion the fight for a public skatepark in Venice, developing relationships with the City of Los Angeles and working to strengthen bonds in the local community.?In June 2000, Juice began its foray into documentary filmmaking with a 7-day excursion to Hawaii with skate and surf legends including Tony Alva, to capture footage for ?úAlong For the Ride.??At the same time, a dynamic line up of surf and skate legends joined the Juice editorial crew, including: Steve Olson, Jay Adams, Christian Hosoi, Jeff Ho, Herbie Fletcher and Dibi Fletcher.After seven years of being a free publication, Juice made the transition to a paid circulation in December 2000 with an introductory cover price of $2.00. In February 2002, Juice was picked up for newsstand distribution by one of the largest magazine distributors in the country, servicing over 9,500 locations, including Barnes & Noble and Borders. Juice then began distribution with a specialty distributor for independent book and music stores at $3.99 cover price. Skate legend, Dave Duncan, also joined Juice in 2002.In 2004, Juice invested in an extensive website and began to build its social media audience across multiple platforms. Juice began to increase international distribution in Germany, Japan and France. Juice also presented the first ever Guinness World Record Wall Ride Contest for skateboarding at Hollywood + Highland, in Los Angeles, California.In 2008, circulation was adjusted from 30,000 to 25,000, after the closing of Borders, and the Juice print publishing schedule and advertising rates were reconfigured in reaction to the economic recession hitting the country. In response to this reality, Juice introduced consulting, public relations, event planning and social media services to its repertoire.?In October 2009, the Venice Skatepark officially opened in Venice, California, an astonishing victory at the end of a long fight to make the skatepark a reality. Juice helped to organize the Skatepark Grand Opening with the City of Los Angeles, and began hosting frequent skateboarding events and contests.?In 2010, Juice launched its event series, the Juice Magazine Surf Skate?àCulture Collection, featuring contemporary and vintage skateboard collections, photography and artwork, transforming the Juice office into a skate/surf/music/art exhibition space. These cultural events also served as fundraisers for Venice locals and non-profits in need of support.?In 2011, Juice began an exclusive collaboration with award-winning filmmaker, Stacy Peralta, providing behind the scenes documentation of ?úBones Brigade:?àAn Autobiography?? from its first days of filming to its debut at the Sundance Film Festival. Through this exciting partnership, Powell Peralta became one of Juice Magazine?ôs biggest advertisers, in print and online.?In 2012, Juice Sk8Tracks, a digital sampler of punk rock music, was launched to introduce new bands as well as current releases from punk rock legends including Jello Biafra, Wayne Kramer, Fishbone & Meat Puppets.In 2014, Juice developed a collaborative relationship with an artistic conclave called the California Locos: John Van Hamersveld, Norton Wisdom, Dave Tourje, Gary Wong, Chaz Bojorquez, Shepard Fairey, Mister Cartoon, Estevan Oriol, RETNA, SLICK and Robert Williams. This project resulted in a variety of events, video projects, books and art shows.In 2015, Juice launched an online video interview series called ?úIn The Van?ù‚Äàin collaboration with revered punk rockers, The Loud Ones. The series finale was celebrated with a Loud Ones concert at Juice headquarters in Venice, California.Juice expanded its outreach into radio in 2016 through a project with Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, and KLOS 95.5 FM?ôs Jonesy?ôs Jukebox Show at the L.A. Times Festival of Books featuring Juice editor and surf/skate icon, Jeff Ho.In 2016, Juice launched its own TV channel on Roku introducing Juice TV to viewers worldwide through a partnership with Barons Media. Juice TV features surf, skate, music and art shows and short films, as well as its ?úIn The Van??series.In the summer of 2016, Juice partnered with internationally-released documentary, ?úMade In Venice?? featuring the story of the fight to get the Venice Skatepark built. While providing publicity services and social media campaigns, Juice also participated in multiple sold out premieres with the film?ôs Producer, Dianne?Lerner,?and distributor, Abramorama.In 2017, Juice was thrilled to work with Shepard Fairey, Glen E. Friedman and Jeff Ho for a behind the scenes video to inform the surf/skate/music/art audience about a special collaboration print featuring the godfather of Dogtown surf & skate. Once the print launched online, it sold out in less than three seconds, one of the fastest selling prints of all time.2018 also saw a vast expansion of the Juice Live Shows on JuiceMagazine.com, including Juice ?úDrop In??interview shows filmed live from the Juice offices in Venice. The Juice Live Webcam, which offers a 24 Hour A Day live feed from the Venice Beach boardwalk, one of the biggest tourist attractions in America with over 30,000 visitors daily, saw continued growth in 2018. In another expansion of Juice brand awareness, AirBNB Experiences selected Juice Assistant Editor, Dan Levy, to host a rare insider look at Juice world headquarters in Venice with his Dogtown Cultural History tour, which includes a behind the scenes look at the Venice Skatepark and brings international visitors to Juice offices daily. In 2018, Juice partnered with Adidas for Beyond the Streets, the definitive showcase of street and graffiti art in 40,000+ square feet of immersive exhibits celebrating skate, graffiti and music in Los Angeles for a four-month exhibit and sold out shows.In 2019, Juice joined forces with Robert Trujillo to present OTTTO, featuring Tye Trujillo, Brian Ferretti and Jonah Abraham, at the Juice 25 Year Anniversary in Venice Beach sponsored by Vans. In 2019, Juice collaborated with?àVans and provided a set location for the Tony Alva Story movie with actor, Josh Brolin. Juice also hosted the Tony Alva movie premiere at the Santa Monica International Film Festival. 2019 also saw Skull Skates launch a Juice collaboration with limited edition skateboards and apparel celebrating Juice 25 Years and Skull Skates 40th year.In 2020, Juice continues to add to its client list, with the addition of The Waterfront Venice and The Winston House, two of the most popular hotspots in Venice Beach, California, and was in the process of planning a series of skateboarding contests and music events in California and beyond, when the coronavirus hit...?===========COMMUNITY & PHILANTHROPY:?===========Juice has always believed in giving back.

That's grants to 80 artists!With your help, we can help even more artists weather this storm.**************Why did The Village create this emergency fund? Put simply, inequities that existed before this crisis persist or have deepened during the crisis.?The COVID-19 shutdowns disproportionately impact artists ??especially lower-income, freelance professionals whose work is event- or client-based ??and Black artists, who have fewer generational resources and savings to cushion blows to employment.?Emergency funds for artists often replicate the same inequities in access because people with more resources are often better positioned to hear about and apply for grants. This fund is intended to counteract this trend.What's ""Gap"" Funding??Artists rely on income from pre-booked performances, events, photo sessions, recording sessions, and teaching artist contracts in order to get by from month-to-month. Due to their narrow margins and the fact that many of them are coming off of a lean winter event season and into the time of year when they begin to make the bulk of their annual income, many artists are in need of emergency cash assistance immediately.?Federal subsidies may provide some relief for creative professionals in the upcoming months. However, artist-entrepreneurs have already suffered losses of income that put them in jeopardy of immediate home eviction, phone disconnection, food insecurity, locked studios, default on credit and loan payments, and other irrevocable losses. New government mandates meant to mitigate these losses (such as moratoriums on home evictions) are not yet being enforced for low-income and extremely low-income citizens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of us, queer writers of color, and supporters of our community, know how important it is to have support, especially financial.?Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, many countries and cities have cancelled major events, and in light of this, many people, presses, journals, etc. have cancelled book tours and readings, which directly support writers; honestly, it puts money directly in their pockets, money that is needed for bills, medicine, food, transportation, creation, and more! Likewise, universities across USA have switched to online only and have closed their campuses, forcing students to go home, but a lot of students, especially black and brown students, especially queer black and brown students don't have this opportunity, and are in desperate need of funds. The closures of universities also effect teachers who rely on these classes to get paid.?This impact has major affects on the literature community as a whole and puts queer writers of color in stressful situations, causing more widespread panic, and while I tip my hat to presses and publishers who have created bundled packages and discounted many of their books, those who aren't affiliated with them are still in need. Even those affiliated with said presses and publishers are in need.?I was very inspired by the efforts of Ijeoma Oluo, who helped create the Seattle Artist Relief Fund?. I want to help, too. I need to help. This fund is to help at least 100 queer writers of color who have been financially impacted by the current COVID-19.

Da foreningens √∏konomi udelukkende afh√¶nger af de sociale aktiviteter i huset, og ikke modtager offentlig st√∏tte af nogen art, har dette medf√∏rt en konkret lukningstrussel af vores alternative spillested. Derfor ser vi os nu n√∏dsaget til at r√¶kke h√¶nderne ud og bede om jeres allesammens hj√¶lp for at vores sted stadig eksisterer n√•r vi en sk√∏nne dag f√•r lov til at √•bne igen. Enhver hj√¶lp modtages med kysh√•nd lige nu.Reffen209:Reffen209 er et frivilligt drevet spillested og kulturhus som til dagligt varetages af Kulturforeningen Reffen209's bestyrelse, foreningens medlemmer og husets brugere.

Disse koncerter og forestillinger vil kobles direkte til vores indsamling, s√•ledes at man nemt og enkelt kan st√∏tte med donationer.Alle midler og donationer som indsamles vil blive brugt p√• at d√¶kke foreningens faste udgifter, og da vores √∏nske er fortsat at kunne lave kultur p√• Refshale√∏en, h√•ber vi derfor at i vil overveje at st√∏tte os i denne sv√¶re tid.P√• forh√•nd tak til jer alle.<3 - Reffen209??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
891,Save City Lights Cinemas,"Created November 17, 2020","Creative Arts, Music & Film","$40,412 ","$65,000 ",310,921,310,"It's Official: City Lights needs your help.?With Friday the 13th's (naturally) announcement of another statewide closure in Oregon, we (the owners, Michael Falter and Susan Tive) are nearing the end of our ability to keep City Lights open for the Florence area community. We've been running as fast as we can to stay solvent and pay our fixed costs: but with no government help on the horizon, we must turn to you for help. That's 65 clams.? 65 Clevelands. 650 Benjamins. That covers the theatre's fixed costs, with current minimal staffing, for 4-5 months.?Here's the backstory.?Rollercoaster: City Lights EditionWhen I was in Middle School, our nuclear family vacationed from Washington to California -- this would be in the early 80's--which culminated as all good vacations for young teens should, at Disneyland. I had a great time, but I learned? quickly that if the ride had a warning for people with pacemakers, I was going to take a hard pass and head to the gift shop.?Well, I can safely say that 2020 has been my personal Return to Space Mountain. The roller coaster that we've experienced has twisted my head and turned my stomach more than once. We closed in March along with many other businesses. Months passed but in June we felt we saw an opening -- and spent $20k to remodel the theatre to go beyond government guidelines for entertainment venues. This includes replacing every other row of seats with tables.?(Photo: A view of Theatre 1 with new tables installed).We reopened for less than a month when we had to shut down, a 2nd time, due to lease issues. This closure lasted another month and came at great expense. We reopened again at the end of August, in time to experience a 3rd (and brief) closure when Oregon experienced devastating fires and suddenly I was vacuuming ash out of the projection booth.?In September and October, though we had very few studio films to play, we steadily increased our small but appreciative audiences. With continued support from the sale of memberships and the occasional donation, we could almost dream of breaking even. With Friday's news, all momentum was lost; as a consequence of the mushrooming virus levels, even more films are moving beyond 1st quarter 2021 to next Summer or Fall, and we're looking at imminent closure.?Boy, That's a LOT of Popcorn:?$65k sounds like a lot of money, but if all 9,103 Florence residents donated less that the cost of a matinee ticket (or $7.14), we'd make it.?The pandemic has taken a toll on businesses far and wide. The film industry is perhaps even more uniquely challenged because it is so interconnected. Hollywood will only release films to the world if New York and LA are open--they drive huge numbers and the media markets are critical for national exposure. It's unlikely that either location will be reopening anytime soon. Thus, even if Oregon allows counties to reopen again within a month or two, we're not going to have a functional industry until April or May or June, even with a promising vaccine or two in the coming months.?Our fixed costs are pretty fixed. We were able to temporarily reduce our rent through March, but with rent, payroll, taxes, utilities, and monthly fees, we are at roughly $15k a month in operating costs.?Our goal is to remain in Florence for years to come. We need help to make it until business can resume, hopefully by April or May of next year.(Photo: A RAIN event. Look ma, no masks! -- This was several years ago.)We Turned 6 in AugustFlorence residents already know what it's like to be without a theatre. We, my wife Susan Tive and myself, vacationed in Florence in 2013 and noticed the vacant Florence Cinemas, sitting lonely at the end of the mall. Our collective experience in working with non-profit art houses made it feel like we were duty-bound to resurrect the town's cinematic meeting place. And so we did. Little did I know that rehabbing a theatre in July in Coastal Oregon would necessitate pitching a tent in the lobby.(Photo: Here's the lobby before much painting and renovation. Note tent in the background. Apologies to any city ordinances forbidding such use.)We dedicated ourselves to making the best theatre experience we could, right here in Florence. With the help of Mister, Art, Alex, Jared, Evan, Paul, and more, we turned the place into the community's living room, complete with craft beer and Oregon's best popcorn with all the fixins.(Photo: Jared and Alex with HAL9000 during our 2001: A Space Odyssey event).We've had so much magic happen in City Lights Cinemas. We have had the great pleasure of befriending a true gentleman and a genius of film sound editing -- Steven Spielberg's regular and John Williams's right hand man, Ken Wannberg. Well into retirement, he wrote and performed a new score for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and was a guest of honor at our 2017 Anniversary celebration where we screened Raiders of the Lost Ark and listened to his stories about the making of.?(Photo: Ken Wannberg enjoying a well-deserved drink after his Q&A, with Michael Falter)It took five years, but we finally paid off the $200k in Digital Projection upgrades in August of 2019. It felt like a giant weight had lifted--and all we had to worry about was Netflix and Amazon taking over the movie business. A pandemic wasn't even in the Top 20 of our threat assessment worksheet.?In our six years of operating as City Lights Cinemas, we've come to know so many of you in our community and beyond. We have regulars who drive from Yachats and Newport from the North, and Coos Bay and Bandon from the south. We regularly provide our space for non-profits for fundraisers or meetings. We love hosting young audiences, like our summer visits from the Boys and Girls Club.?(Photo: Boys & Girls Club with Michael)We have donated thousands of tickets to fundraisers of all persuasions and we look forward to supporting our community for a long time to come.?We still believe in happy endings and can't wait for this movie to be over.?(Photo: Yes, I have climbed on the roof to see if there was a pot of gold.)Thank you for reading and considering a gift at this critical time.

After a long search for affordable space we fell in love with a mill building in Holyoke. We have a beautiful building with a total of 40,000 square foot in a diverse and challenged city in Western MA. The city has a rich history and amazing potential.? We decided to buy the building and create a community, art and cultural center.? We put our hearts, time, sweat, money and tears into creating this multi-functional venue.? We had to totally redo the building to bring it up to code. Our opening helped bring other new businesses to the area, thus greatly contributing to the beginning of the revitalization of the downtown.? What began as a small art venue for studios and classes has morphed into a restaurant with food and alcohol, event spaces, live theater, and a world class music venue for local, national and internationally touring bands.? GCA is a destination and brings thousands of people to the area annually.Vitek, my partner, comes from the Czech Republic and his training is in restoring castles, cathedrals, buildings and creating/restoring fine art.? My background is totally different- I am a Physical Therapist by training and discovered art as an adult.? What does this have to do with anything? Our interests and values intersect around people- our desire to be in community, our interest in justice, learning, creating and inspiring.? We began building Gateway (GCA) by doing most of the construction ourselves and it slowly evolved into a complex, multifaceted business with almost 40 employees and volunteers at one point.? They are local, dedicated and believe in our vision.? We worked hard at creating a professional environment in whatever we offer and welcome everyone to our facility.? We grew from small concerts to sell out crowds of 500 people with national touring bands.? GCA is home to a terrific puppeteer company, an alternative theater group, artists, craftsmen, and people from start-up to career professionals in various fields of art, design and performing arts.? And we have events from corporate meetings and retreats to weddings!YOUR HELP WILL KEEP THIS VITAL VENUE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY OF ARTISTS, THE CITY OF HOLYOKE AND THE PIONEER VALLEY. WE DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO KEEP GOING DURING THIS TIME.?PLEASE HELP WITH ANY SIZE DONATION--It is more than welcome and extremely appreciated.??THANKS FOR LISTENING-With gratitude,Lori and Vitek#SmallBusinessRelief",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please watch our latest trailer on this link :) WINE and WAR Trailer?WINE and WAR?is due for global release in September and the film?ôs collaborators Mark Johnston, Mark Ryan and Michael Karam are pledging up to $50,000* to Cap-Ho, a Lebanese charity that provides much-needed medical care to those without insurance.?An amazing journeyTheir adventure began in 2013, when, inspired by Michael Karam?ôs award-winning book Wines of Lebanon, the trio teamed up with a mission: to change perceptions of the region and explore an enigmatic and misunderstood country by producing a feature length documentary that celebrated Lebanese entrepreneurship in times of conflict and instability through the lens of wine. The film will not only highlight the determination of Lebanon?ôs winemakers, but also the remarkable story of the Lebanese throughout history. And while the film is called WINE and WAR, the focus is really on a remarkable people, fighting to live and work in difficult conditions very often not of their own making.This unique documentary explains this historical journey, with testimonies from those who fought to make wine in the 1975-90 civil war, the 2006 summer war, and those who continue to produce in the shadow of regional instability. Their astonishing stories tell of bravery, determination, and survival and how wine can be a unifier and a metaphor for life, hospitality, civilization, and a force for good in a region defined by turmoil and animosity.An epic wine cultureLebanon?ôs relationship with the vine culture stretches back, almost 7,000 years. In the second millennium BC, the Phoenicians, a Canaanite people who inhabited the Levantine coast, created a powerful trading empire that gave the gift of wine to the then known world, including Greece and ancient Rome. They were the first wine merchants!The power of the DiasporaThe Lebanese have continued to travel the world. So while there are 4.5 million people in Lebanon, there are a further 10 million of Lebanese descent scattered across the five continents and they can be instrumental in changing the perception of Lebanon, through a film that can renew a sense of identity and pride among a huge diaspora scattered across the world.A story more relevant now than everBut above all, as we brace ourselves for change not seen in our lifetime, WINE and WAR is a compelling reminder that history is fraught with challenges that have been faced and ultimately overcome. In a region that is not automatically associated with wine, it is a story of epic achievement, one that shows the best side of its humanity, it?ôs history; it?ôs tradition of hospitality, and its generosity of spirit.In a time of global angst, when Lebanon is not only dealing with the Covid pandemic, but also fighting corruption, environmental crises and sectarian politics not to mention navigating choppy economic waters, the WINE and WAR is a timely reminder that uncertainty is a way of life for many but that out of uncertainty can come remarkable resilience, and positivity. We need your help With 300 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every minute and 5 billion videos watched every day, we need your help to navigate the blizzard of content that so often blinds us these days. WINE and WAR is finished but we need to raise $50,000 to pay for the marketing of this legacy film. ?We could do it for more, or maybe less but the amount will allow us to genuinely achieve a global audience that will show Lebanon in a positive light.? A global movementOur following on Facebook and Instagram, especially in South America is growing quickly and we have produced a short fund-raising film, which highlights our support of Cap-Ho and a ?úteaser?? both of which are attached. A full ?útrailer??will follow very shortly.?Perceptions are everything today and we have the film to change them, but we need your support to give Lebanon a voice.?Please let us know what you think, and if you have any ideas to make this exciting joint initiative more impactful please reach out to us.Lastly here is a link to view the WINE and WAR Trailer?*Whatever money is generated from funding raising, up to $50,000, will be matched in a contribution to Cap-Ho from the films revenues",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The corona virus has closed these venues indefinitely because of the city's shelter-in-place rules.While Dan and Laurie Pessano, at GCP, and Roger Rocka, who owns the dinner theater, have vowed to re-open as soon as possible, there will likely be major restrictions on public gatherings when they do.

It is a mix of artists that represent the vibrant and resilient San Francisco music scene. Hyde Street Studios is one of very few remaining recording and music production facilities that artists can go to work on their music in San Francisco.?Coming into 2020, the studio was booked out for months solid and going strong. After the shelter in place order, all studio sessions were cancelled. Being in an industry that works on very small margins already, with the loss of these bookings, after 40 years of operation, we now find ourselves in a dire situation. This campaign will allow us to pay the bills to weather this crisis.The studio has fostered a wonderful community of musicians, engineers and producers and we want to make sure it is still there for everyone on the other side of this pandemic.We're also looking into every means of financial support for the business. Unfortunately, we've found that we're ineligible for some primary federal and city assistance grants and forgivable loans that many other small businesses are getting. In the recording industry, the engineers that work in recording studios are freelance workers, and having a traditional payroll staff is a requirement for these programs. There are other grants we've applied for, which of course we are not guaranteed to get, and certainly wouldn't meet our short-term needs. Because of this, we must ask for your support. This is a strange and trying time for everyone, and we understand there are many people and institutions in need. We feel that Hyde Street Studios is a valuable asset in the San Francisco cultural landscape. If you?ôre in a position to support us we?ôll be extremely thankful for your generosity.

Framed albums include?Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's?De Ja Vu,?Tupac Shakur's?Tupacalypse Now, and most albums by The Dead Kennedys. I've recorded many of my vocals in the same spot where Grace Slick sang 'White Rabbit.""?Throughout the years it was not uncommon to see various legends who made Hyde Street Studios their home, like Michael Franti, George Clinton and our beloved friend Butch (RIP) who looked out for us. I even showed Linda Ronstadt around the kitchen area while I was working on Sun Kil Moon's April in studio A and she was working upstairs in Studio D.With the ever-changing climate of the music industry? - including a serious decline of physical album sales - I saw Hyde Street Studios survive obstacles that other local studios did not.??Now they've come upon their toughest battle with the coronavirus. With musicians out of live income and the economy being what it is, record labels are now wary to fund projects that cannot be promoted by tours.Many people have asked what's kept me in San Francisco - a city that I've fallen a little out of touch with - with the boom of technology. I always say the same thing: ""Swan Oyster Depot, my apartment, and Hyde Street Studios.""I recorded there very recently and I'm going to do what I can to help keep the place going. I mean, what is San Francisco, without Hyde Street Studios? A place to hang my hat and get good Oysters? Fuck that.

Intentionally regressive policy reform has led to increased systematic discrimination against Trans people. This has led to the loss of vital protections in healthcare, housing, homelessness resources, and the cruel and sudden exclusion of Trans people from military service. These are fundamental human rights, all of which are necessary for our survival.The violent murders of Black Trans Women and Trans Women of Color remain at epidemic levels. In 2020 we have already seen too many brilliant individuals taken from this world by force. The public should be a safe place for Trans and gender non-conforming people to exist freely.It is our goal to reclaim public space for the Trans community.Our bodies are holy ground, our magic is potent and true, and our existence makes the world a more loving and equitable place for all. We have always been here and always will be. We demand safety for our community. We demand the right to exist without being targeted. We demand understanding. We will continue to work tirelessly until these demands are met.Now is the time to bring our light into the world like never before.In July of 2019, Transgender artist and activist Jonah Welch? launched a billboard in Detroit, Michigan, in collaboration with Save Art Space? and Ellen Rutt?. The billboard proclaimed ""Trans People Are Sacred,??a phrase that was first shared with Jonah by Dakota Camacho? years earlier while they were residents of the Audre Lorde Cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin.The billboard was intended to strengthen representation and inspire hope for Trans individuals in Detroit, but the piece spread like wildfire. The billboard reached a global audience. The words, Trans People Are Sacred, took root, and catalyzed profound healing for individuals and communities the world over. After the success of the initial billboard, Save Art Space reached out to Jonah Welch to create a national-level project for this work.?Now we have the opportunity to spread this message even farther.WE NEED YOUR HELPIt is our goal to place these billboards in one hundred cities across the United States, with a distinct focus on conservative areas in the south and southwest. The billboards will go up between mid-September and mid-October, just weeks before the election, so that our voices can be heard. Because of its inherent accessibility and visibility, it is our belief that public art holds the potential to shift culture. Each $1000 we raise will allow us to place a billboard in another city. The additional $52k will be used to pay 52 Trans & Non-Binary BIPOC artists $1000 each for their work (50 visual artists and two curators). And while our initial goal is $152k, we hope to exceed this amount and cover the country with this beacon of hope.?CALL FOR BIPOC ARTISTSWe are dedicating the majority of billboard space to the work of Trans & Non-Binary BIPOC artists. All art must include the phrase ""Trans People are Sacred"" or a culturally-rooted variation on this phrase specific to the artist. (ex: ""Black Trans People are Sacred""). We encourage artists to interpret this phrase through the lens of their ancestral language and culture. Each selected artist will be paid $1000 for their work.The cohort of BIPOC artists will be selected by Dakota Camacho? and Ryan Young?. For submission guidelines, to suggest a billboard location, or to inquire about press opportunities please contact Jonah via the Gofundme contact form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non chiuder? per l'emergenza Covid, che certo ha peggiorato la situazione, sono le leggi dello Stato che lo espongono a questo rischio. English version at the bottom - Version fran√ßaise en bas de pageIl Teatro della Contraddizione √® una realt? culturale di Milano, uno spazio da 99 posti, che dal 2000 ha sede nello storico quartiere di Porta Romana. E' un progetto nato dal basso, che, secondo le leggi economiche, non dovrebbe esistere cos√¨, senza appoggi, legittimazioni, senza genitori culturali, economici o politici. Una possibilit? rubata alla cruda realt?, grazie alla passione e alla lucida follia di tutti gli utopici passati da qui in questi 20 anni: un noi fatto di artisti, tecnici, spettatori. In nome di qualcosa di pi√π grande di noi, un'Opera, un Progetto, un ideale artistico, abbiamo messo in secondo piano l'utile personale per esaltare l'urgente, il necessario. L'attitudine a mettere davanti a tutto la funzione artistica e sociale ci ha portato fin qui, cos√¨ come l'idea di lavorare per un bene comune, quando intorno le istituzioni gridano che l'arte √® prima di tutto un'impresa. Questo, in grande sintesi, √® il genere di Noi che √® stato condannato penalmente per esercizio abusivo di locale di pubblico spettacolo. E cosa c'√® di pi√π assurdo che accusare questi utopici dell'arte, se non di essere degli imprenditori? Il Reato consiste nell'aver fatto entrare due agenti della polizia annonaria, che si sono finti spettatori, facendogli la tessera associativa la sera stessa dello spettacolo, mentre gli altri spettatori, quelli veri, erano tutti tesserati. Sia chiaro, i vigili non c'entrano, mandati, facevano il loro lavoro.A partire da questa condanna √® scattata la macchina burocratica dello Stato, con ripetuti controlli ed infine prescrizioni. Se non faremo entro il 29 luglio una serie di lavori e non produrremo le certificazioni richieste, il teatro verr? chiuso con l'aggravante di una multa pesante. I lavori restanti ammontano a 70.000 euro. Una cifra molto alta, insostenibile per noi. Ci siamo rivolti a varie istituzioni ma nessuna pu√≤ o vuole venire in nostro soccorso. Non √® una situazione singolare, √® sistemica, non esiste nessun percorso che permetta, dimostrata la propria capacit? organizzativa e artistica, di trasformare uno spazio privato in uno spazio pubblico. Per questo tutti gli spazi culturali si devono rifugiare nell'associazionismo, unico rifugio precario che consenta di fare cultura dal basso. E su tutti pende una spada di Damocle, basta una persona, un controllo e tutto pu√≤ crollare. Lo sanno tutti: lo sa chi va a fare i controlli, lo sanno le istituzioni, soprattutto quelle territoriali; tutto per√≤ √® lasciato alla discrezione dei singoli comuni, si tollera, si chiude un occhio, per non assumersi la responsabilit? di dare una risposta collettiva ad un bisogno, che consenta l'esercizio dell'attivit? culturale, libera e democratica. Le barriere economiche costituiscono la censura contemporanea; la sicurezza, con i suoi parametri stringenti, soffocanti per un teatro piccolo, crea una selezione di specie, la specie pi√π povera deve per forza essere rappresentata dalla specie pi√π ricca. Noi siamo per la pluralit?, √® un bene che la ricchezza venga investita in cultura; che aprano pure altri 1000 spazi culturali, purch√© non ci siano ostacoli a che tutti siano rappresentati. E quando parliamo di rappresentanza non ci riferiamo solo a chi gestisce quello spazio, ma anche a chi pu√≤ permettersi di frequentarlo. Perch√© √® cosa nota che i grandi teatri sono finanziati per la gran parte da fondi pubblici, quindi fondi della comunit?, ma che solo pochi possono permettersi di entrarci, dati i prezzi proibitivi. E' ovvio che la responsabilit? non √® dei teatri ma dell'insufficienza dei fondi erogati dallo Stato, ma la situazione non cambia: chi non pu√≤ permettersi di andare a teatro finanzia chi pu√≤ permetterselo. E' paradossale ma questa √® la realt?.Abbiamo aspettato fino all'ultimo, ma siamo qui e ci rivolgiamo a voi in questo momento difficile per tutti, perch√© il tempo sta scadendo e in qualche modo, anche fallimentare, dobbiamo reagire. La situazione meno piacevole che potesse capitarci √® quella odierna: lanciare una richiesta di aiuto quando tante realt? rischiano di affondare. Noi ci abbiamo provato, per 20 anni, da soli, cercando un aiuto in pratiche istituzionali, accessibili a tutti, trasparenti, ma queste pratiche in Italia non esistono. Abbiamo lottato, sfruttando noi stessi, siamo arrivati sin qui, ed √® un traguardo per noi, ma √® chiaro, non possiamo pi√π farcela da soli. Anche se √® questo che avremmo voluto, in cui abbiamo creduto. Non pensiamo sia giusto essere qui, a chiedere un gesto straordinario a voi, un gesto che ci salvi. In un paese sano questo non dovrebbe accadere, non dopo 20 anni di duro lavoro per la comunit?.Ma non abbiamo scelta.Tutti i donatori saranno invitati a lasciare la propria impronta e il proprio nome sulle pareti esterne del TDC; un rito lungo un giorno, per firmare il salvataggio del teatro.La Realt? artistica della Contraddizione Il Teatro della Contraddizione √® un luogo, una compagnia, una comunit?.Nel 2000 prende il via la Stagione Sperimentale Europea, un vero confronto con compagnie indipendenti italiane ed europee, un processo che ha portato il TDC a ricoprire il ruolo di ?úincubatrice??regalando spazio e tempo a quelle compagnie di grande qualit? ma di poche risorse, che ha consentito agli artisti di sviluppare la propria identit? espressiva, senza conformarsi a ci√≤ che nel mercato ha un riscontro immediato. Per il TDC, sia come realt? produttiva che di ospitalit?, la ricerca di una nuova grammatica contemporanea e allo stesso tempo la costruzione di nuovi ponti verso il pubblico sono strumenti necessari per intercettare l'essere umano in continua trasformazione, per mettersi al suo fianco e affrontare il suo e il nostro spaesamento. ?úPalcoscenico su cui √® passato parecchio del bello delle ultime stagioni. Una voce fuori dal coro capace di selezionare fra le ombre. Dove la ricerca sul nuovo diventa perentoria. Nei linguaggi e nei temi??(Diego Vincenti, Il Giorno)??..il Teatro della Contraddizione propone creazioni che hanno la cifra dello spettacolo-happening, dell?ôincontro teatral-performativo, qualcosa che esorbita dalla logica della fruizione teatrale in senso stretto.

It may close permanently on July 29th.Covid-19 is not the cause, although it has certainly made the situation worse.?Rather, the laws of the Italian State are responsible for the danger in which TDC suddenly finds itself.Teatro della Contraddizione is a registered ?úcultural association?? a 99 seat theatre space operating for the past twenty years in the historic district of Porta Romana, Milan.TDC is in every sense a grassroots project. It is a theatre which receives no public funds, has no cultural partners or political sponsors, and exists in complete defiance of any economic imperative, or indeed logic.? TDC exists thanks only to the passion and lucid madness of all the utopian idealists who have entered its doors for the past 20 years; be they artists, technicians, or spectators.We have always put our artistic and social function ahead of everything (including ourselves) and always with a key idea in mind: a theatre must work for the common good. Meanwhile official institutions regularly remind us that art must be, above everything, a successful commercial enterprise. So, it is grimly ironic that we have been convicted of an ?úabusive exercise in running a public entertainment activity?? We feel compelled to ask: what could be more absurd than accusing us, idealists and utopians, of being entrepreneurs?So what exactly happened? In Italy we are not allowed to operate as an officially recognised theatre. For bureaucratic purposes, we have to go under the banner of ?úCultural Association?? By law, a spectator must be a member of our cultural association and have a membership card in advance of buying a ticket. One evening we welcomed two undercover police officers, posing as spectators, into our theatre and gave them each a membership card for our cultural association, so that they could buy a ticket and attend the play we were presenting that same evening. All the other spectators in attendance (i.e. the real ones) were already registered in our database, as required by law. Of course, the policemen had nothing personal to do with this, they were just doing their job.We were immediately charged and subsequently found guilty by the courts. For simply selling a ticket to our show, we are now required to carry out building renovations, to the amount of 70,000 Euros. If we don?ôt carry out the work and produce the required certifications by the 29th July we will be closed down permanently. On top of that we will also receive a heavy fine.That sort of money is impossible for us. We have approached numerous institutions, but none has offered to come to our aid. It is important to note that ours is not an isolated situation. Rather, it is a systemic one. In Italy, all cultural associations operate underneath a Sword of Damocles: a single person, a single complaint, a single official visit, is enough to make it collapse. Everybody knows this, of course: inspectors, police officers, public institutions, local administrations. Yet everything is left to the arbitrariness of the individual municipal councils. Everybody turns a blind eye, so as to avoid taking responsibility for giving a collective response to a social need: the exercise of cultural activity, freely and democratically.?In the contemporary world, economic barriers now constitute censorship. Stringent and suffocating health and safety regulations which restrict a small theatres from operating, create a selection of species: only the richest among us can afford to operate the smallest and poorest of? cultural activities. It is well known that big theatres receive most of their income from public funding (i.e. funds provided from the community, via taxation). However only the wealthiest among us can afford to buy a ticket, given the exorbitant prices. It is clear that the responsibility does not lie with the theatres but, rather, stems from the insufficient funds provided by the state. In other words, those who cannot afford to go to the theatre end up subsidising those who can afford to go. This is paradoxical, but this is reality.We believe in plurality. It is a great thing that wealth is invested in culture. But all cultural spaces must be heard and represented. And when we talk about representation, we are not only referring to the voices of those who manage these spaces, but also the many voices of their public.We have waited until the very last minute to make this announcement, in the hope that we could come up with a different solution. But time is running out and we must act. That is why we have decided to turn to our community to ask for help. This is the most unpleasant decision we have ever made: launch a call for help when so many of us are at grave risk and every one of us is somehow in trouble. For 20 years we have been trying to get institutional help. We have struggled and we have exploited ourselves. We have come so far, and we have reached some of our goals, but it is now clear that, in order to continue to exist, we can no longer walk alone. Even if that is what we have always believed in, as an independent cultural venue.We do not think it is fair to find ourselves in this position now, asking for an extraordinary gesture on your part, a gesture that can save us. This should not happen after 20 years of hard work for the community. Unfortunately, we have no choice.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Version fran√ßaiseLe Th√©√¢tre della Contraddizione risque de fermer le 29 juillet.Il ne fermera pas ? cause de l?ôurgence Covid, qui sans doute a aggrav√© la situation, ce sont les lois de l?ô√âtat Italien qui l?ôexposent ? ce risque.?Le Th√©√¢tre della Contraddizione est une r√©alit√©?culturelle de Milan, un espace de 99 places, situ√© dans le quartier historique de Porta Romana depuis les?ann√©es?2000.

Au nom de quelque chose de plus grand que nous-m√™mes, une ?uvre, un Projet, un Id√©al artistique, nous avons plac√© au deuxi√®me plan le profit personnel, pour exalter ce qui √©tait urgent et n√©cessaire. L?ôaptitude ? mettre au premier plan la fonction artistique et sociale nous a soutenus jusque-l?, de m√™me que l?ôid√©e de travailler pour un bien commun, alors que tout autour les institutions crient que l?ôart est avant tout une entreprise. Ceci, en un mot, est le genre de Nous qui a √©t√© condamn√© p√©nalement pour exercice abusif d?ôun local de spectacle public. Et qu'y a-t-il de plus absurde que d?ôaccuser ces utopistes de l?ôart d?ô√™tre des entrepreneurs?Le crime consiste ? avoir fait rentrer deux officiers de Police, qui ont ?fait semblant d?ô√™tre des spectateurs, en leur √©tablissant une carte d?ôinscription le soir m√™me du spectacle, tandis que les autres spectateurs, les vrais, √©taient tous inscrits. Que ce soit clair : les officiers de Police n?ôont rien ? voir avec cela car, en mission, ils accomplissaient leur travail. ? partir de cette conviction la machine bureaucratique de l?ô√âtat a d√©marr√©, avec des contr√¥les r√©p√©t√©s et, pour finir, des ordonnances.Si nous ne faisons pas avant le 29 Juillet une s√©rie de travaux et que nous ne produisons pas les documents requis, le?th√©√¢tre?sera ferm√© avec les circonstances aggravantes d?ôune lourde amende. Les travaux?restants?s?ô√©l√®vent ? 70 000?? Une?somme?√©norme, insoutenable pour nous.?Nous nous sommes adress√©s ? plusieurs Institutions mais aucune ne peut ou ne veut venir ? notre secours. Ce n?ôest pas une situation singuli√®re, c?ôest syst√©matique, il n y a aucun parcours qui permette, malgr√© la d√©monstration de sa capacit√© organisationnelle et artistique, de transformer un espace priv√© ?en espace public. Pour cette raison tous les espaces culturels doivent se r√©fugier dans l?ôassociationnisme, le seul refuge pr√©caire qui donne la possibilit√© de faire de la culture d?ôen bas. Et sur toutes les associations est suspendue une √©p√©e de Damocl√®s, il suffit d?ôune personne, d?ôun contr√¥le, et tout peut s?ôeffondrer. Tout le monde le sait: ceux qui vont faire les contr√¥les le savent, m√™me les Institutions, surtout celles territoriales: cependant, tout est laiss√© ? la discr√©tion de chaque municipalit√©, on tol√®re, on ferme les yeux pour ne pas prendre la responsabilit√© de donner une r√©ponse collective ? un besoin, qui autorise l?ôexercice de l?ôactivit√© culturelle, libre et d√©mocratique. Les barri√®res √©conomiques constituent la censure contemporaine; la s√©curit√©, avec ses param√®tres rigoureux, √©crasants pour un petit th√©√¢tre, cr√©e une s√©lection des esp√®ces, les esp√®ces les plus pauvres doivent n√©cessairement √™tre repr√©sent√©es par les esp√®ces les plus riches. Nous, nous sommes pour la pluralit√©, c?ôest un bien que la richesse soit investie dans la culture; que l?ôon ouvre 1000 autres espaces culturels, ? condition qu?ôil n?ôy ait pas d?ôobstacles et que chacun soit repr√©sent√©. Et quand on parle de repr√©sentation on se r√©f√®re non seulement ? ceux qui g√®rent l?ôespace, mais aussi ? ceux qui peuvent se permettre de le fr√©quenter. Parce qu?ôil est bien connu que les grands th√©√¢tres pour la plupart sont financ√©s par des fonds publics, donc des fonds de la communaut√©, mais que seuls quelques-uns peuvent se permettre d?ôy entrer, √©tant donn√© les prix prohibitifs. Il est √©vident que la responsabilit√© n?ôest pas des th√©√¢tres, mais du manque de fonds accord√©s par l?ô√âtat, et la situation ne change pas : qui ne peut pas se permettre d?ôaller au th√©√¢tre finance qui peut se le permettre. C?ôest paradoxal mais c?ôest la r√©alit√©.Nous avons attendu jusqu?ôau dernier moment, mais nous sommes ici et nous nous?adressons ? vous dans un moment?difficile pour tout le monde, parce que le temps est?compt√© et que nous devons r√©agir, quelle qu?ôen soit la mani√®re, m√™me si d√©faillante.

Among these sacred spaces, those that cater to queer art and performance are doubly important. For many of us, we remember a time when places where we could go and live out loud and celebrate our way were few and far between. For 26 years The Cavern Club Theater, has been one such place. The Cavern Club has been home to Drag and LGBT+ Performers, as well as any number of artists, freaks, and self-proclaimed ?úFruitCakes.??Throughout its storied history, the Cavern Club has always encouraged artists to express themselves freely, which has lead to nearly three decades of shows unlike any other. Because of this celebratory commitment to outrageous spirit, the Cavern Club has been host to a vast array of some of the performance world?ôs very best, including the likes of?¶The Plush Life.

It is our hope to be able to keep hosting artists and performers in the years to come, providing a space where they can live free and dream big, even if it?ôs on a little stage. But, in light of the recent global situation and the impact the Covid-19 virus has had on the world of art and performances spaces?¶we need your help.Even as government officials debate the next steps, with no firm timetable for the easing of stay-at-home restrictions, the Cavern Club Theater remains dark and needs financial assistance to be able to weather this storm. Hopefully, that?ôs where you come in. First and foremost, you may be wondering how the campaign settled on the $15,000 amount as the goal. The answer is simple: We took the monthly operating cost of the theater, which averages around $2,500/mo and looked ahead to 6 months to when the world may feasibly be returning to communal spaces. Funds raised through this campaign, on behalf of Daniel Derkacz (a.k.a. Mr. Dan), will go not only toward the theater?ôs rent, but also coverage of utilities, insurance, payroll assistance, wigs, heels, and dresses (?¶well, ok, maybe not those last three). Should the Cavern Club be able to safely re-open before the 6 month dark period, or should the campaign substantially surpass its goal, the additional funds will go to help support the artists that contributed to this magical venue.Simply put, by supporting the Cavern Club Theater in these unprecedented circumstances, you are proclaiming that art is important and VITAL.

917,Produrre il futuro che vivremo insieme,"Created June 21, 2020","Creative Arts, Music & Film","??3,702 ","??0,000",212,637,212,"Durante le ultime settimane ci avete inviato numerose email, messaggi e video pieni di affetto dove ci chiedevate come poterci sostenere dopo la cancellazione della tourn√©e e lo spostamento dell'uscita del nuovo album. Questo ci ha toccato il cuore. Il vostro affetto e l'attesa che percepiamo attorno alla pubblicazione del disco ci √® di grande sostegno in questo periodo!Dopo avervi ascoltato abbiamo deciso di rispondervi da qui, a cuore aperto, raccontandovi sinceramente ci√≤ che stiamo vivendo in casa The Sun (?∫il nostro sito web).Molti sanno che siamo una band indipendente, eppure forse pochi sono consapevoli del fatto che da ormai sette anni lo siamo gioiosamente in un modo particolarmente ?úspinto?? Cosa significa? Nei nostri 23 anni di musica abbiamo lavorato con numerosi ?úattori??di spicco del mercato discografico - dalle piccole etichette alle multinazionali - collaborando con grandi agenzie di concerti, editori internazionali, manager capaci. Questo ci ha aiutati a maturare come artisti e professionisti, rendendoci via via pi√π consapevoli delle nostre capacit?. Tuttavia il tempo e il nostro cammino di Fede ci hanno portati a voler gestire sempre pi√π autonomamente la nostra proposta musicale. Perci√≤ da anni autoproduciamo tutto quello che ci riguarda e lo autogestiamo appoggiandoci esclusivamente ad un solido distributore che mette l'artista al primo posto (Artist First), senza alcun altro tipo di intermediazione. Ci√≤ significa niente etichette discografiche, manager, editori, investitori esterni. Solo noi: un piccolo gruppo di persone affiatate e accomunate dagli stessi valori in un cammino di amicizia e fraternit?. Una scelta controcorrente che difendiamo con amore.Essere i The Sun oggi √® certamente straordinario, ma difficile. In un mondo musicale che sta tendenzialmente abbassando la qualit? dei suoi contenuti in favore di una superficializzazione generale, noi viviamo con un chiodo fisso: vale la pena continuare a dare la vita per comunicare il Bene. E il Bene va fatto bene.Da sempre ci battiamo affinch√© questo valore cresca. Lo stile riconoscibile dei The Sun ne √® una prova: abbiamo lavorato affinch√© le nostre proposte e produzioni raggiungessero standard qualitativi di alto livello (dischi, videoclip, tourn√©e, spettacoli, ecc). Questo ha permesso alla nostra musica e testimonianza di incidere positivamente sulla vita di tante persone. Al contempo, per√≤, vi confessiamo che la nostra strada √® spesso in salita. Per capire il motivo di questo basta accendere la tv o la radio: noterete che il mondo discografico e quello mediatico sono ormai perlopi√π restii a veicolare canzoni che risvegliano le coscienze - in particolare se chi le propone ha chiare radici cristiane. E guarda un po'... chi sono i The Sun? ;)Sia per chi √® lontano dalla fede sia per chi la vive, che ci piaccia o no, nei pi√π svariati ambienti siamo identificati (additati o riconosciuti) come l'espressione di riferimento in Italia della musica d'ispirazione cristiana. E nella sostanza, professionalmente, quali conseguenze produce? Aldil? dell'onore che porta con s√© una tale considerazione, nel 2020 significa anche essere costantemente oggetto di scherno, in una posizione complicata su numerosi fronti: spesso siamo ?útroppo cristiani??per chi √® lontano dalla fede, ma avviene pure che siamo ?útroppo professionali??per chi vive in ambienti vicini alla fede. Niente paura, siamo abituati, e fa parte della vocazione a cui siamo chiamati, ma desideriamo condividervi ci√≤ che viviamo.Nonostante un contesto complesso, arriviamo comunque da anni meravigliosi pieni di luce. Grazie a Dio ci sono tanti ""Spiriti del Sole"" che ci vogliono bene e amano ascoltare una musica libera e che libera! In tutto questo, i nostri eventi pubblici sono da sempre il nostro traino: dal vivo ci si incontra, √® l√¨ che moltissimi di noi si sono conosciuti e che decine di migliaia di persone hanno apprezzato le nostre canzoni e iniziato a volerci bene.Il blocco che stiamo vivendo da mesi, avvenuto in seguito alle disposizioni normative per il Covid19, nostro malgrado ci sta costringendo ad una prolungata pausa forzata, giunta esattamente quando tutto ci√≤ che riguarda il nuovo album e il tour stava per decollare. La musica registrata e quella dal vivo, nel nostro caso, sono parte di un unico grande messaggio che, disgiunto, perde il suo significato pi√π vero. A poco sono serviti i nostri sforzi per provare a ripartire con eventi pubblici: troppe le difficolt? esterne che impediscono ad oggi una concreta riorganizzazione della tourn√©e (normative stringenti che differiscono da regione a regione, recepite in modi ulteriormente differenti da comune a comune), con il conseguente slittamento in avanti della pubblicazione del disco.Dopo una riflessione di gruppo, perci√≤, abbiamo deciso di aprire questa campagna di raccolta fondi e di sincera condivisione della produzione del nuovo album dei THE SUN per poterlo lanciare adeguatamente non appena il contesto ci permetter? di pubblicarlo e suonarlo dal vivo.Durante il 2019 abbiamo scritto molte nuove canzoni e lo scorso dicembre abbiamo fermato la tourn√©e per entrare in studio di registrazione. Sono stati mesi di grande lavoro e creativit?, ma a marzo siamo stati costretti a bloccare tutto. La tourn√©e doveva cominciare il 28 maggio e l'album sarebbe stato pubblicato poco dopo. Purtroppo tutto √® stato posticipato: niente uscita del disco, niente tourn√©e. Sapete, non √® facile accettarlo, anche perch√© coloro che hanno ascoltato i nuovi brani sostengono che questo sia il nostro miglior album di sempre!Dopo aver autofinanziato la prima parte di produzione dell'album (circa 20.000 ??, i fondi messi da parte per autoprodurre e sostenere la pubblicazione del disco stanno diminuendo per fronteggiare questi mesi di stop forzato. Da tempo siamo impossibilitati a lavorare e, a causa di un vuoto normativo, i lavoratori del nostro settore sono lasciati perlopi√π senza alcun tipo di sostegno o prospettiva, essendo la nostra un'attivit? che si basa principalmente sulla programmazione e sugli assembramenti.Il 22 giugno sono dieci anni dalla pubblicazione del nostro primo fortunato album #SpiritidelSole. Disco autoprodotto tra mille difficolt? in un periodo di blocco lavorativo assoluto per il gruppo, innescato dalla conversione di Francesco (come racconta nel libro ""La strada del Sole"", Rizzoli). Ci fu possibile continuare la produzione di Spiriti del Sole solo grazie al sostegno e alla generosit? di alcune persone che ci diedero un aiuto concreto. Quelle persone credettero al nostro modo nuovo e diverso di fare musica. Se oggi siamo qui, lo dobbiamo anche a loro. Ci√≤ che stiamo vivendo in questo periodo assomiglia ai mesi che hanno preceduto la pubblicazione di quel fortunatissimo album.Se molti di noi, di voi, hanno fatto esperienze meravigliose, intessuto amicizie, cominciato cammini nuovi, trovato forza e coraggio partendo dalla nostra musica, √® anche grazie a chi, nel momento della nostra pi√π grande crisi, ci sostenne per portare a compimento un percorso che, se fossimo stati soli, sarebbe stato molto diverso.Al momento abbiamo in mano un motore straordinario: le canzoni registrate nei mesi scorsi, ma manca tutto il resto per permettere a questo motore di scendere in pista ed essere lanciato adeguatamente. Quando la situazione ce lo permetter?, vorremmo subito pubblicare il disco e tornare a suonare.La vostra disponibilit? ci ha incoraggiati e, dopo alcune riflessioni, abbiamo deciso di realizzare con voi un progetto di autentica condivisione della seconda parte di produzione dell'album, una parte indispensabile che ora non saremmo in grado di costruire con la dovuta qualit? che contraddistingue da sempre la produzione dei The Sun.I prossimi passi per completare il lavoro di produzione dell'album e successivamente lanciarlo sono:- il mastering;- realizzare gli shooting fotografici;- creare le grafiche del disco e per la comunicazione;- produrre i videoclip;- predisporre la comunicazione;- ufficio stampa;- fare gli eventi di lancio.Tutto questo coster? 30.000 ??(che si vanno ad aggiungere a quelli gi? spesi finora per la registrazione in studio, l'affitto della strumentazione, il lavoro dei tecnici/produttori, la produzione del video ?úLettera da Gerusalemme??. Ci sono numerose persone e professionalit? coinvolte e, in totale, per produrre tutto e lanciare il disco ci vogliono tante risorse: s√¨, fare le cose bene nella musica costa e cogliamo?l'occasione per dirlo apertamente. Perci√≤ ogni volta che acquistate un nostro disco, libro o ci invitate a realizzare un evento nella vostra citt?, permettete a questa storia controcorrente di esistere e resistere luminosamente!A questo punto ci siamo chiesti che cifra ?úfissare??come obiettivo di questa campagna. Abbiamo pensato che 2/5 della spesa generale (cio√® 20.000 ??, pu√≤ essere una buona ipotesi, anche se... non mettiamo limiti alla Provvidenza!Non si tratta di un sostegno a fondo perduto: per chi vuole, insieme all'Officina del Sole (?∫visita il sito), risponderemo alla vostra generosit? con diverse esperienze e possibilit? che vi elenchiamo di seguito. Perch√© non vediamo l'ora di tornare a stare insieme a voi, a suonare, a camminare insieme!!!Il 22 giugno esce anche il nostro nuovo singolo ?úUn buon motivo per vivere?? E' il nostro messaggio per ognuno di voi. Anche se siamo nella difficolt?, siamo certi che tutto sar? per il bene. Questo tempo di prova diventer? una benedizione. Perch√© c'√® sempre un buon motivo per vivere, per ridere, per scrivere, per credere.

We?ôve had incredible guests such as Julie Adenuga, Ian Wright, and Ray BLK gracing our airwaves, with special shoutouts from O.G?ôs such as Daniel Sturridge and Adele. No Signal has created a home for a wave of New Black Radio.Now, we want to make that home permanent.With your help, we are looking to crowdfund ¬£450,000 to secure HR Studio 1 - a home for all High Roller operations, including your favourite new radio station No Signal, and your favourite party RECESS - to begin building a new generation of Black-owned media and entertainment.#NSStudioFundHIGH ROLLER: THE VIBESFounded in 2015 by brothers Jojo and David Sonubi, High Roller is a creative company, comprising of No Signal & RECESS.No Signal?úLabelling themselves #blackradio, they play music from across the African diaspora that folds into the diverse spectrum of black British identity, and are creating a space of community and relief for black Britons at a traumatic yet galvanising historical moment.??- Aniefiok Ekpoudom?Described as ?úa space for black entertainment for those currently representing us today ??and as a platform that ?úhas shown the power of grassroots entertainment ?? No Signal is a radio station for the people. Comprising of 14 team members and spearheaded by a team of incredible women, No Signal operates 7 days a week with around 40 shows and 115 hours of homegrown entertainment across your airwaves.Here are a few things some of the team have to say about No Signal:?úNo Signal embodies Afro-futurism. It's about Black people operating outside of the constraints of society.??- Ghadir Mustafa, No Signal Playlist Team.?úThere needs to be a place we can healthily have Black discourse on media platforms to take control of Black narratives. When football legend, Ian Wright, wanted to publicly talk about his experiences of racism, he came to No Signal before anyone else. We want No Signal to be the place where members of our community can speak about the things that need talking about and be listened to.??- Huda Ahmed, No Signal Executive Team.RECESSOver the last 4 years, RECESS has gone from a Thursday night basement party to a leading light in the London party scene. From day parties across London to taking over Ibiza, we?ôve been able to create space for Black people to truly enjoy themselves.It?ôs a well-known issue for Black parties to be denied access to venues or to be heavily policed, as well as Black people being denied entry to certain clubs. The growth of RECESS has created a space where Black joy is centered without fear of stereotyping. We aim to keep growing and help push our scene forward.HR STUDIO 1: THE VISION#BlackRadio isn?ôt a new concept. We stand on the shoulders of great pioneers such as DeJa Vu, Heat FM, Choice FM, Rebel Radio, and Kiss FM to name a few. However, the precariousness of Black-led spaces has left very few of these stations standing today. In Jojo?ôs article, only we can tell our stories, we share our experiences of taking over spaces by Black communities, for Black communities. Racism and anti-blackness have kept Black communities from permanently owning our spaces for too long. With your help, we aim to step forward and create homegrown Black British content that resonates with communities around the world. We want to create a sustainable home for the future of #BlackRadio and entertainment.We are already in conversation with a space in the heart of North London and have begun dreaming up the possibilities for the studio.¬£100,000 allows us to rent a physical space for HR STUDIO 1 for 2 years.¬£300,000 allows us to rent a physical space for 2 years and pay 14 members of staff to run the HR STUDIO 1 operations. From presenters and producers to DJs and designers, High Roller doesn?ôt work without its team, and we are committed to paying people for their time and turning media outlets like No Signal Radio into a viable career option.¬£450,000 allows us to achieve all of the above while fully kitting out our studios with the best equipment and design.G-CHECKING USThis is an ambitious, long-term project, and the lead-in time for something like this could take a few years. There are many milestones to hit, funds to get into place, and people to get on board to make this vision a reality for us all. We understand the importance of transparency and public accountability, especially when our community is investing back into us. We?ôll be keeping you all updated with our progress by:- Updating our community on how we progress with securing the site via our social media channels- Sharing progress images of the studio, from design to realisation- Introducing you to the team behind the scenes of No Signal & RECESS each monthNo Signal cannot just be a moment in lockdown?ôs history, and RECESS deserves to be a consistent source of Black joy. These are the first steps to a homegrown media platform, and we have bigger ideas to transform the ways Black stories are told and Black entertainment is distributed. HR STUDIO 1 is the vehicle to a true and authentic source of entertainment, engagement, and education. This only works if it is wholeheartedly for us, and by us.We hope you support us in our journey of building a new home for us all.Nuff love,Jojo & David Sonubi & the High Roller Team",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We (his mother and I) intend on opening up a bank account/trust fund from which he can withdraw the campaign funds on an as need basis.?Kevin Belcher is a 16 year old rising junior and budding musician at Maynard Jackson High School in Atlanta, Georgia. Having overcome many obstacles in order to pursue his dream of becoming a prominent and successful musician, his aspirations were finally realized. On June 17th, 2020, Kevin was accepted into the world renowned Interlochen Arts Academy to study classical clarinet! (Learn more about Interlochen here. https://www.interlochen.org/)?Kevin has managed to navigate himself through personal adversity and persevere through many obstacles. He has managed to hold strong in his pursuit of his dreams, despite the lack of examples to visualize himself in the spaces he desires, and as a result, the temptation to give up. And although he is blessed to have family, friends, and teachers who uplift and push him; he still requires major financial support in order to fully realize his pursuits to attend Interlochen.

He understands that it is not going to be easy. However, he believes, with our support, he will be prepared for the inevitable challenges that lie ahead and will be reinvigorated to put in the work to pursue his dreams and aspirations.

Covid-19, however, presents a unique set of obstacles. Kevin must self-isolate for two weeks in a hotel before reuniting with his family. The generosity of Michigan Law students has ensured that he will have meals delivered for the entirety of his quarantine. Once that is over, Kevin will need to obtain basic life necessities -- beginning with a place to live and a means of transportation. Kevin will likely be entitled to some form of civil compensation, but that is a long and grueling process that can take months or even years. Your support will mean that Kevin can hit the ground running with the resources he needs for his life as an exonerated man.?We have had the privilege of working as Kevin's student attorneys this past year with the Michigan Innocence Clinic. The first time he spoke with us, he told us that he knew that ""this was the year he would walk out of prison."" ?Kevin?ôs relentless optimism never wavered. Kevin wrote a brief in his own defense and helped other inmates with their legal proceedings while incarcerated.? Now that he's free, he hopes to create a more equitable criminal justice system and work on behalf of the wrongfully incarcerated.You can learn more about Kevin's story here: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/exonerated-man-freed-prison-now-hotel-quarantine-i-could-watch-n1192326",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

945,Nova Peris - Bronze Statue,"Created June 15, 2020",Celebrations & Events,"$30,020 ","$30,000 ",336,4.2K,335,"This is an artists impression of what Nova's statue will look like if we can raise the $30k!??A range of requests have been made for support from government, but none have been willing to contribute.?In keeping with supporting Aboriginal artists, Jandamara? Cadd is going to partner with Gillie and Marc Art to create the piece.?Even if you can only afford $5 or $10 we would love your support! (Artists Impressions below)BACKGROUND TO THE PROJECT AND NOVA PERIS OAM OLY - STATUES FOR EQUALITY PROJECTNOVA PERIS OAM OLY - AUSTRALIAN LEGENDAt the Atlanta Games in 1996, Nova was the first Aboriginal person to win an Olympic Gold Medal as part of the world-dominant Hockeyroos, and was also the first mother since Shirley Strickland, in 1956, to claim Olympic Gold. She then switched sports to athletics and won Gold in the 200 metres and 4x100 metres relay at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. Then, at Sydney Olympics in 2000, Nova reached the 400 metres semi-final and was a member of the 4x400 metres relay team which finished fourth in the final breaking an Australian and Oceania record. To this day, she remains the only person in the world to make back-to-back Summer Olympic finals in two different sports at consecutive Games!Post-sport, Nova has worked tirelessly in fighting for better rights for Aboriginal people, and for people of all walks of life. Notably, in 2013, she became the first Aboriginal woman elected to Federal Parliament, and her maiden speech highlighted the struggles facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As the first of many speeches Nova gave during her time in the Senate, hers was a strong, determined voice of an emerging leader who envisioned great things for her people. As always, she was prepared to act as their voice, and she did this through various speeches on Aboriginal affairs, never shirking an issue; instead meeting it head on, with an honesty and connectivity that is sometimes absent from our political leaders. In being elected to Federal Parliament, Nova broke through that ceiling for Aboriginal women.? A number of incredible Aboriginal women were inspired by Nova and followed her footsteps into Parliament.?A dedicated mother and highly sought-after public speaker, Nova continues to leave her mark since exiting Federal Parliament. Injustice and inequality drive her quest to improve the lives of Australians everywhere, and for her statue to stand proudly alongside other inspirational women in Melbourne would show everybody that by fighting for your rights, and having boldness to chase your dreams, is a life worth living. For everyone.?A STATUE FOR THE PEOPLEFor generations, inspirational and hard-working Australian women have left their mark on our thriving, diverse and ever-changing country. Whether fighting for social justice, delivering medical advancements, striving to excel on the sporting field, or championing equal rights in the halls of parliament, the list of outstanding women is long and varied.It is with this in mind that internationally renowned Australian public artists, Gillie and Marc Schattner, are endeavouring to celebrate a collection of their country's most inspirational women, and to have their works displayed in a prominent public arena accessible by all.? In Australia, this will start with Nova Peris.? Having achieved success internationally with similar projects, such as their 'Statues for Equality' in New York City, the Schattner's want to shine that spotlight on the women of Australia by producing a number of statues to be unveiled along Melbourne?ôs iconic river walk.?Each statue will be expertly crafted in everlasting Bronze, presenting larger than life figures of a carefully considered selection of women from different arenas,? which will allow for each statue to become a centrepiece for discussion and reflection during a time when inspirational figures are needed to ensure the next generation of leading women can emerge.?Amazingly, despite gender equality being a leading topic worldwide, only three per cent of the public statues throughout Melbourne depict women. Therefore, by adding more female faces, a clear statement is being made that the acts of women are as important and worth celebrating as the achievements of men. And, importantly, it sends the loud and clear message to young women and school-aged girls that they, too, can achieve anything they set their minds to; that there is no glass ceiling; that we are all equal, that there is no colour divide, and that we can all leave our mark. Indeed, creating equality is integral to the advancement of humanity.?For?Gillie and Marc Schattner to achieve their aims, and so that we can have our women given the prominence they deserve, we are asking for the public's help in raising just $30,000 in order to fund a statue of one particular inspirational Australian trailblazer, Nova Peris.?Why we need these fundsThe next exhibition of statues will take place in the next 12 months. So we need to secure $30,000 public contribution as soon as possible to help get the statue designed and cast.?We're asking for everyone to chip in what they can and to share with their friends and families to make this incredible statue a reality.?What happens after the exhibitionThe statue will need to be moved and permanently placed. This will be negotiated with the Nova Peris Foundation board.?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seit dem Jahr 2013 befindet sich das SchwuZ in den R√§umen der alten Kindl-Brauerei in Neuk√∂lln an seinem mittlerweile vierten Standort. Die R√§ume werden durch die SchwuZ Kulturveranstaltungs GmbH betrieben, die zu 100% dem SchwuZ e.V. geh√∂rt. Das SchwuZ geh√∂rt somit direkt der Community und nicht irgendeiner Privatperson.Durch den Umzug wurden in die R√§ume am Standort Neuk√∂lln bis heute rund 1,5 Millionen Euro investiert. Dar√ºber hinaus hat das SchwuZ aktuell rund 100 Besch√§ftigte und im Durchschnitt monatlich rund 300 Dienstleister_innen wie DJs, K√ºnstler_innen, externes Personal, Techniker_innen die bezahlt werden m√ºssen.So ist es um unsere Finanzen bestellt:Das SchwuZ hat in den letzten drei Jahren 2017, 2018 und 2019 einen Jahresumsatz von je zwischen 1,9 und 2,2 Millionen Euro erwirtschaftet. Dabei lag der Gewinn/Verlust VOR Steuern jeweils zwischen? MINUS 100.000 in 2017 und PLUS 40.000 Euro in 2018. Die Bilanzen sind ver√∂ffentlicht und k√∂nnen jederzeit eingesehen werden √ºber den Bundesanzeiger. Die Verteilung unserer Kosten strukturiert sich im groben wie Folgt: rund 50 Prozent der Ausgaben t√§tigen wir f√ºr unsere Belegschaft (L√∂hne, Geh√§lter, Sozialabgaben). Damit ist das SchwuZ einer der gr√∂?ten Arbeitgeber_innen im queeren Bereich der Stadt. Dar√ºber hinaus gehen die Ausgaben hierf√ºr drauf: Mieten, Versicherungen, Tilgung eines Darlehens f√ºr den Umbau der neuen R√§ume im Rahmen des Standortwechsels, GEMA-Geb√ºhren, Honorare f√ºr Dienstleister_innen wie DJs, K√ºnstler_innen, Reparaturen, Ersatzbeschaffungen, Wareneinkauf der Getr√§nke, Marketing und Werbung, Steuern und Bankgeb√ºhren. Die wenigen ?bersch√ºsse werden direkt wieder in die R√§ume und unsere Belegschaft investiert. Wir zahlen √ºber dem gesetzlichen Mindestlohn und haben gerade den Umbau einer unserer drei Bars in Auftrag geben und den gr√∂?ten Teil davon schon im voraus bezahlt. Auch macht das SchwuZ zahlreiche Veranstaltungen die betriebswirtschaftlich nicht rentabel - daf√ºr umso wichtiger f√ºr die Community - sind. Und zwar weil wir es wichtig finden, das es solche Veranstaltungen gibt. Das m√ºssen wir uns als Community-Ort leisten. Und das werden wir uns auch weiterhin leisten.Warum sammeln wir jetzt Spenden?Weil wir wissen, das unser aktuelles Polster sehr d√ºnn ist und wir ohne Unterst√ºtzung bei laufenden Kosten h√∂chstens wenige Wochen √ºberleben k√∂nnen. Nat√ºrlich haben wir bereits alle Hebel in Bewegung gesetzt, um den Kostendruck zu reduzieren wo es geht. So haben wir Stundungen der Steuernach- und Vorauszahlungen, der Mieten, der Beitr√§ge zur Sozialversicherung und der GEMA-Geb√ºhren beantragt. Das dauert jedoch je nach Empf√§nger_in einige Zeit und wir k√∂nnen nicht immer eine positive Entscheidung voraussetzen. Das Aufschieben von Zahlungen bedeutet √ºbrigens nur, dass diese zu einem sp√§teren Zeitpunkt f√§llig werden. Auch haben wir bereits den Willen mit unserem Betriebsrat eine Vereinbarung zu treffen, um Geld f√ºr Kurzarbeit bei der Agentur f√ºr Arbeit zu beantragen. Auch hier m√ºsst ihr wissen, dass beispielsweise Besch√§ftigte mit Mini-Job keinen Anspruch auf Kurzarbeiter_innen-Geld haben. Das ist f√ºr uns sehr schwer. Wir wollen ja vor allem mit dem gesamten Team weitermachen, sobald wir wieder d√ºrfen. Da wir jedoch zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt kaum absehen k√∂nnen, wann und wie es weiter geht, sammeln wir jetzt Spenden ein. Wir k√∂nnen aktuell noch nicht absehen ob eine Verl√§ngerung der Schlie?ung √ºber den 20. April hinaus ansteht ??dies w√ºrde die Gefahr uns in wirtschaftliche Schwierigkeiten zu bringen deutlich erh√∂hen.Insbesondere ist auch noch nicht absehbar, ob nach einer Wiederer√∂ffnung der Betrieb sofort wieder auf 100% hochf√§hrt.?Wir m√ºssen also auch nach Wiederer√∂ffnung mit Einbu?en rechnen. Die gestrichenen Einmietungen im Vermietungsgesch√§ft bis Sommer k√∂nnen wir definitiv nicht mehr reinholen.Auf die versprochenen Hilfen der Politiker_innen k√∂nnen und wollen wir uns nicht verlassen. Derzeit sind zwar Programme angek√ºndigt, aber noch nicht umgesetzt. Nat√ºrlich werden wir alle Hilfsangebote die f√ºr uns in Frage kommen, auch in Anspruch nehmen - wann das ist, wei? jedoch heute noch niemand.?Wof√ºr geben wir die Spenden aus?Wir wollen diese in drei Bereiche gliedern: Zuerst wollen wir mit dem Geld m√∂glichst lange die Belegschaft und damit die Arbeitspl√§tze im SchwuZ sichern. Haben wir mehr Geld als ben√∂tigt eingesammelt, wollen wir im zweiten Schritt K√ºnstler_innen, die sich in besonders prek√§ren Situationen befinden, Einnahmen erm√∂glichen (bevorzugt FLTI* & Queer Refugees). Damit wollen wir m√∂glichst unb√ºrokratisch von uns einen Beitrag zum Bestreiten deren Lebensunterhalts erm√∂glichen. Sollte es dann immer noch Mittel geben, die wir zur Verf√ºgung haben, werden wir den Betrag an Lesvos Lgbtiq+ Refugee Solidarity? spenden, die sich held_innenhaft um die Situation insbesondere von queeren Gefl√ºchteten an den Europ√§ischen Au?engrenze k√ºmmern.Wir wissen, das jeder Cent den wir erhalten ein echter Vertrauensbeweis in unsere Arbeit und die Institution SchwuZ ist.Wir versichern euch: wir werden euer Vertrauen nicht ent√§uschen.Jede Spende erw√§rmt unsere Herzen und macht jede_n einzelne_n Spender_in zu einem besonderen Menschen in unseren Gedanken.Danke euch f√ºr eure Unterst√ºtzung und euren Support.Euer SchwuZ-Team.#saveourschwuzWhy we collect donations for SchwuZ and what we?òll spend them onWe want to work as transparent as possible:SchwuZ was founded in 1977 and is Germany's oldest queer club and largest queer cultural institution. SchwuZ has been located in the rooms of the old Kindl brewery in Neuk√∂lln, its fourth location in 43 years, since 2013The rooms are operated by SchwuZ Kulturveranstaltungs GmbH, which is 100% owned by SchwuZ e.V.. The SchwuZ therefore belongs directly to the community and not to any private person.As a result of the move, around 1.5 million Euros have been invested on the premises at the Neuk√∂lln location to date. In addition, SchwuZ at this moment has around 100 employees and an average of around 300 freelancers working for the club, such as DJs, artists, external staff and technicians who all have to be paid per month.Our finances are as follows:SchwuZ has generated annual sales of between 1.9 and 2.2 million Euros in the past three years in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The profit / loss before taxes was between MINUS 100,000 Euros in 2017 and PLUS 40,000 Euros in 2018.The balance sheets have been published and can be viewed at any time.The distribution of our costs is roughly structured as follows: We spend about 50 percent of our expenses on our workforce (wages, salaries, social security contributions). This makes SchwuZ one of the largest employers for queers of ?ã‚Äãthe city and in all of Germany.In addition, the expenditure goes towards: rents, insurance, repayment of a loan for the renovation of the new rooms as part of the change of location, GEMA fees, fees for freelancers such as Djs & artists, repairs, replacement purchases, purchase of drinks, marketing and advertising, taxes and bank fees.The small surplus is reinvested directly into the location and our workforce. We pay above the minimum wage and have just commissioned the renovation of one of our three bars, but have paid most of it in advance.The SchwuZ also comissions numerous events that are not economically profitable - making them all the more important for the community. Such as roundtables, discussions etc. We invest in those, because we think it is important that there are such events. We have to be able to afford that as a community place. And we want to be Every donation warms our hearts and makes each individual donor a special person in our thoughts.able to continue to afford that.Why are we collecting donations now?Because we know that our current cushion is very small and that we can survive for a few weeks at most on it. Of course, we have already set all levers in motion to reduce the cost pressure wherever that is possible.For example, we have applied for deferral of tax payments and advance payments, rents, social security contributions and GEMA fees. However, depending on the recipient, this takes some time and we cannot always assume a positive decision.And postponing payments only means that they are still due, although at a later date.We also have the will to make an agreement with our works council to apply for money for short-time work at the employment agency. Again, you need to know that employees with a mini job, for example, are not entitled to short-time workers' money.This is all very difficult for us. Above all, we want to continue with the entire team as soon as we are allowed to. However, since we can hardly foresee when and how it will continue, we are now collecting donations.We cannot yet foresee whether the closure because of the Coroana Virus will be extended beyond the 20th of April by the city council of Berlin - this would significantly increase the risk of causing us unsolvable economic difficulties.In particular, it is still not foreseeable whether the business will immediately start up again at 100% after a reopening. We must therefore expect losses even after reopening. We definitely can't get the canceled rentals in the rental business until summer back. They are a big loss for us.We cannot and do not want to rely on the promised help from politicians. Programs have been announced but have not yet been implemented.Of course, we will also take advantage of all the offers of help that come into question for us - but nobody knows when that is.What will we spend your donations on?We want to divide them into three areas: First, we want to use the money to secure the workforce and thus the jobs at SchwuZ for as long as possible.If we have collected more money than needed, in the second step we want to provide income for artists who are in particularly precarious situations (preferably FLTI * & Queer Refugees). We want to enable us to contribute to their livelihood as unbureaucratically as possible.If after that there are still funds available to us, we will donate the remaining amount to Lesvos Lgbtiq + Refugee Solidarity (https://www.facebook.com/LesvosLGBTIQRefugeeSolidarity/), who are heroeically taking care of the situation, in particular of queer refugees at the European border.We know that every cent we receive is a real vote of confidence in our work and the institution SchwuZ. We assure you: we will not disappoint your trust.Every donation warms our hearts and makes each individual donor a special person in our thoughts.Thank you for all your help and support.Your SchwuZ team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On July 20, June was fired from her job as a senior pastor. We are building a team around June and her family as they prepare for an uncertain future. As part of Team June, you can help alleviate some financial burdens during this time of transition. Help June with the expenses of life as she moves into this next chapter of her story so she is free to do so slowly and steadily, in wholeness and with boldness.We, her friends, have set an ambitious goal because we want to anticipate both short-term and long-term needs. We know her influence has already been far-reaching, and we trust your generosity and support will be as well. No matter what we raise, the whole of it will reach June and will speak to her of our tremendous love for her and our belief in this next chapter of her story.If you're still reading and would like to know a little more, particularly about that ambitious goal, we believe that living as her authentic self may cost June a livelihood for some time--beyond any benefits or severance she may receive. She is a great pastor and an excellent preacher, but we know that full-time pastorates for trans women are few and far between. In fact, transgender individuals in Ontario face three times the national unemployment rate, according to transequalitycanada.com.?In June's sermon on June 14, she preached about holding this precious pearl, and brilliantly shared her story with the world. We know that living as their authentic selves costs too many trans people everything, and June's bold life is one we are all so lucky to witness.

As a result, blacks were not able to join celebrations, attend seminars or participate in cultural events held at public locations . To address the needs of African American Angelenos, Fannie Williams and Della Williams, wife of world-renowned architect Paul Williams, with 50 enterprising women purchased the Wilfandel, a Revival Mediterranean style house. They envisioned the house for individuals of all races and ethnicities to participate in civic events and family celebrations.?This campaign is a collaborative effort of the multi-generational African American women Wilfandel members who range in age from 45 to 95. We represent a wide spectrum of industries and professions with high stations in government, executive positions in academia and executive positions in the private sector.??We joined the Wilfandel to preserve its legacy of community outreach through civic betterment, philanthropic endeavors, scholarship and cultural enrichment. ?We share fond memories of attending art exhibits, book signings, poetry readings, workshops, seminars, lectures, rituals, celebrations and civic meetings with our family, members of the community and noteworthy individuals at the Wilfandel. Other professional and nonprofit organizations also schedule events at the stunning edifice. Over the decades, the Susan B. Komen Foundation, Language Immersion Charter School, Albert McNeil Jubilee Singers, LA Association of Black Professionals, Top Ladies of Distinction Inc and St. Bridget Catholic Church have held exquisite events at the house. As a nonprofit, the Wilfandel offers reduced rental rates to similar organizations.?Wilfandel Club Challenges Racial CovenantsIn 1945 the 50 visionary, trailblazing African American women purchased the house after raising funds for the down payment over a 3-year period. The ladies celebrated their club?ôs tenth anniversary with the payoff of their $28,000 mortgage. ?The ClubhouseIs located in the West Adams Terrace Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ), in Los Angeles, California and was built in 1912. The two story, 6254 sq. ft. house has 5 bedrooms, 4 baths and gardens on an expansive 18,000 sq. ft. corner lot. A detached garage is topped by a one-bedroom guest apartment. The ground floor houses the club?ôs business office, a large kitchen and dining area, the lanai and the public rooms used for countless meetings, lectures, concerts and charitable activities. On the upper floor are the separate ?òBride??and ?òGroom??suites and a conference room.?Although the Wilfandel is not a historically designated landmark, it is highly regarded by the Los Angeles Conversancy, the largest preservation organization in the United States. Located in the preservation zone signifies that the house has historic, architectural, cultural or aesthetic significance. The Wilfandel is currently reviewing the requirements of the City of Los Angeles Cultural Heritage commission to determine if the house will qualify as a Los Angeles Cultural Monument. ?75-Year Legacy of Cultural SignificanceThe club provides people of all races and cultures affordable access to an elegant venue for social and civic activities. We recognize the importance of remaining relevant as the demographics of the surrounding community continue to change. Over the years the nonprofit has been vital to the civic infrastructure of LA?ôs black community. Recognition of the historic legacy of the West Adams community and the ability to respond to the needs of the surrounding areas, are essential to the future of The Wilfandel Club.?Wilfandel Fundraising EffortsThe members recognize preservation as a cost effective way to remain relevant in the community and have participated in several efforts to generate capital. In 2013, the Restoration and Preservation fundraiser was launched and a Donor Wall exhibits the benefactor?ôs names prominently displayed in the lanai.??The Wilfandel was recently awarded a grant to $75,000 to preserve historic African American cultural sites. The funds were allocated to make plumbing, electric and foundation upgrades to the 1912 building. The Wilfandel board decided the clubhouse would be closed January through April 2020 to complete the upgrades.?In March, the members hosted a cultural fundraiser at the Nate Holden Performing Art Center in Los Angeles. The proceeds have been used to cover general operating expenses. In total, the club has raised approximately $125,000 for preservation and operations. Challenges: Impact of COVID-19 and Social Distancing EventsSince April when Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that Los Angeles would ?òshelter in place??to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, the Wilfandel has been closed.? COVID ??19 has severely affected the Wilfandel?ôs ability to receive essential rental revenue. As Los Angeles prepares to reopen, the members are in the process of determining how to effectively enforce social distancing at all club events. ?Preservation and RenovationCompleted and Remaining UpgradesThe plumbing and electrical upgrades were completed in April 2020. Given the age of the structure, the building understandably requires regular maintenance and repairs. The remaining grant funds will be used to plaster, paint and fix the crumbling foundation that was identified in a recent inspection. The board is also aware of the need to update the house to be Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant.?RenovationThe guest apartment over the garage has sustained significant damage. The roof, plumbing and electrical systems need repair along with the structural damage to the walls and flooring. Since affordable housing is one of Los Angeles most pressing issues, the renovation of the guesthouse could provide affordable housing to address the shortage and a source of income for the club.?Additionally we envision creating a commercial kitchen out of the existing conventional one. There is no commercial kitchen available to prepare food for catered events within a 4-mile radius of the property. The kitchen could be rented out to qualified and vetted chefs as another source of income.?The ProcessStructural integrity and public safety are our primary concerns.? Consistent with the Secretary of Interior?ôs Standards and Principles, special consideration will be given to the historic use and the original design aesthetics of the property.? Construction will adhere to local standards and all current building codes. All work will be conducted by a licensed contractor, the proper building permits will be obtained and all inspections completed and approved.?BudgetOur campaign goal is to raise $500,000.General operations - $30,000 due to loss of rentals as a result of COVID-19Preservation - $50,000Renovation - $170,000?Help Continue the Wilfandel?ôs legacy. It Matters! A 2018 study conducted by the Los Angeles Conservancy Commission found that historic places contribute to the overall livability of the city and provides real value for every Angelenos. ?As an historic civic organization our goals are service, sustainability, longevity and continued relevance.? The funds raised by ?úOur Black Legacy Matters: The Wilfandel Preservation and Legacy Campaign??will ensure that the clubhouse continues to remain a valued and respected resource and expand its ability to serve the community. The Wilfandel Club seeks funds to renovate a one-bedroom guest apartment; create a commercial kitchen; improve, revitize and upgrade to preserve the structure; and to cover operating expenses due to a loss of rental income as a result of COVID-19.?We seek to build our online and social media presence and to forge deeper relationships and collaborations with institutions, our neighbors and the Los Angeles community at large. We envision the clubhouse as a unique and wonderful destination for scheduled civic events throughout the year.?The Wilfandel?ôs cultural significance legacy matters.

With no credit and limited income, they were unable to get an apartment and have been living in a Studio 6 Motel since then and the mom juggles payments for rent vs for the storage in which they had to put their belongings. John loves books and will spend hours in ¬Ω price book store reading a book, hiding it so no one buys it and then catching up next time he can walk to the store.

Its post-apocalyptic charm makes this site unique in Germany, offering many individual development opportunities. We want to continue to preserve this unique site and fill it with life.But the ravages of time are gnawing away the buildings tirelessly. Over the last 3 years we have fought to save an infrastructural reserve to be able to preserve building 23 in the long term by renovating the roof in due time. This reserve has since been sucked up by the corona crisis and the resulting recourse claims.We still MUST renovate the roof this year to prevent deeper structural damage to the building in winter.Why House 23 is important to us and why we want to preserve it:House 23 is the pulsating life of the FALLEN - Bad Land , as an enclave the heart of the hopefully soon reorganized, Zombie Attack? and the perfect backdrop for the PRIM?.It is the largest building in our play area that is still fully usable and provides the space we need and use for a main backdrop with its approx. 1.800m¬≤. The building structure is solid and with a little effort it can be almost completely preserved for further years.With that, we have a long-term weather-protected space that we and all participants can use for creativity, ideas and diversity.This is what we want to achieve!Our request to you:We need your help to preserve Mahlwinkel as an event site.Every donation is a hammer blow from the roofers, a piece of roofing felt, gas to run the burners, 1kg on the scales of the recycling centre or much more!Mahlwinkel is not only a hobby for us as an organization, but a matter of the heart. Throughout the year we spend a large part of our free time and holidays planning and preparing the next event.Our players also invest a lot of time, creativity and passion in the design of the scenery and with an eye for detail they create a lot of things to discover in the end.The result is an inspiring collaboration, which also includes the premises with their diverse possibilities and challenges.A few facts about roof renovation:Area to be repaired: approx. 1.800m¬≤Rehabilitation period: approx. 4 weeksWo/man Power: approx. 15 personscost: approx. 55.000??

The main goal of the cultural form of live role-playing is to create an atmosphere in a fictional world in which everyone can rise above themselves, discover new talents and develop themselves and others.As a participant, you become part of a fictitious social structure and are not assigned to any social class. Everyone comes together on the playing field.As a LARP organiser, the balancing act between the desire for reality and the participants' imagination is a challenge.We have made it our business to give many people the opportunity to take part in our events and therefore we all work on this project free of charge throughout the year. The revenue from the ticket sales is invested directly into infrastructure such as showers/toilets/electricity and basic game elements.Cost report of the roof refurbishment:Our events are becoming more and more popular and we can now host up to about 700 participants.Cost report of the roof refurbishment:55.000??

976,#SaveSoulFest,"Created May 22, 2020",Celebrations & Events,"$16,397 ","$150,00",154,431,152,"These are hard times for many and while it?ôs hard to ask for help,SoulFest?ôs future depends on it.SoulFest, an annual 3-day Christian Music Festival focused on Music, Love, & Action, is produced by New Sound Concerts, Inc., a 501c3 started by Dan and Alison Russell in 1978 to bring Christian music to New England. SoulFest?ôs purpose is to celebrate God?ôs love and encourage all who attend to live from the inside out as soul-connected, risk-taking Believers in God?ôs love. The first SoulFest was held in 1998 at Loon Mountain, in Lincoln, NH, and is approaching its 23rd celebration, which will be held at Gunstock Mountain Resort in Gilford, NH (host location since 2004). New Sound Concerts has been producing and promoting Christian concerts in New England for over 40 years and finds itself at a crossroads to carry on.With little revenue coming in due to the impact of COVID-19,compounding previous debt, our attention is also turned towards the Russell family as they focus on Dan?ôs recovery from his mid-April stroke and ensuing medical bills.SoulFest experienced a large financial loss in 2019; we were working hard to implement new ideas and focusing on a fresh lineup to make up for the loss, which was working until COVID-19 hit American soil. When ticket sales slowed, plus vendors and sponsors were being financially impacted and pulling back, closing that gap became more difficult, let alone continuing to pay our small staff. Our paycheck protection loan delayed, forcing layoffs just as SoulFest co-founder, Dan Russell, had a stroke affecting his left (dominant) side. As a singer-songwriter working on his second album, and the creative voice behind SoulFest, this has been incredibly hard on Dan, his family, and the broad community of SoulFest friends beyond the New Sound team.It became apparent that by August in New Hampshire, we would likely not be able to hold an event, even to the size of 2019, forget about increasing attendance. Costs would increase to provide for new social distancing protocols, coupling with low attendance, and put us even further in debt. Postponing became our only option. The live music landscape and gatherings are greatly changed for 2020 and beyond, though we have hope and great anticipation for what they will look like in 2021. This is a highly innovative time in our history. We are pivoting, regrouping, listening, and moving forward.It?ôs not all grim, but the legacy and continuation of New SoundConcerts and the SoulFest depend heavily on the support of itspatrons and anyone who cares to continue to see this communityand gathering sustained in New England. This annual event supports the local economy by bringing 8,000-10,000 people to the Laconia area to experience spiritual growth, rejuvenation, and adventure, sending them back inspired to take LOVE into their homes, communities, and around the globe.We need to raise funds to support the New Sound Concerts team in finding a sustainable path forward with the changing landscape for live events and the Russell family through this time of recovery and healing. This $150,000 will provide stability to navigate the new terrain of gathering around SoulFest?ôs mission, ensuring its platform continues to share the hope and love of God through music.Any amount helps #SaveSoulFest. Exceeding this goal does too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether you call him Mark, Marky, Mr. Lipson or Slippy, you know that this man's generous heart shines in all that he does.The layers of crisis are real and very dire, but we can help lighten the load. Mark has done so much for the organic sector and this earth-connected community we call home. Now it?ôs our turn to show him how much we care.Over his 40 years of service, Mark has mentored and supported many of today?ôs organizational leaders. The list of his volunteer and community-building achievements is endless. I, Liz Birnbaum, founder and CEO of The Curated Feast, am one of the lucky mentees. I also lovingly call him my adopted California dad (though I've done that behind his back until now).You know that Mark is one of the original founders of the organic movement we have today. You know that he was the first paid employee of California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), and among so many other professional and community accomplishments, has been a Partner at Molino Creek Farm since 1983.But did you know that Mark is under tremendous stress and very much needs our help?As he turns 64 (what I?ôll always think of as Sgt. Pepper age) on October 19th, it's not only time to reflect on this man?ôs tremendous gifts to the world, but it?ôs time to step up and support him.These funds will make it possible to:+ Repair the infrastructure of Mark and Cassandra?ôs home (the many parts not covered by insurance).+ Repair the domestic water and fire-fighting supply?îwhich we know will be essential in the coming years.+ Remove approx. 500 (literal) tons of Douglas Fir tree that came down in the front yard.+ Create an additional living space for on-site help (one of Cass and Mark?ôs kids) for fire recovery and Cassandra?ôs care.+ Upgrade Mark?ôs vehicle, which was damaged due to the fire, so he has transportation for an upcoming wet winter.?Searching for the C word(s).Mark has been his partner Cassandra's primary caregiver since her cancer diagnosis in 2019. As she completed her treatment in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, severely hindering Mark?ôs ability to regain viable work. Cass now needs surgery imminently due to unforeseen rare complications.A 20-year cancer survivor himself and someone who lives with congenital heart condition that has required multiple surgeries, Mark also carries the burden of personal health concerns.Then came the fire.The CZU Complex Fires tremendously damaged the Molino Creek Farm Collective. Mark?ôs home was thankfully not destroyed (because of hero Bob Frank!), however the damage to the land and community was immense. Busy managing the Molino Creek Farm GoFundMe and other disaster recovery, he personally needs our support!Molino Creek is covered in ash.?I went up to Molino Creek last weekend, and seeing the dome, the land, and the lines that fire burned on the homes gave me tears, goosebumps, and deep shock. The impact on the hearts and minds of the whole community cannot be overstated.Folks, these are tough times for all. The only way we?ôre going to get through this is by loving and supporting one another as we each carry the burden of challenging times and a changing climate.

983,My Life With Ben,"Created January 23, 2020",Celebrations & Events,"$15,375 ","$2,001 ",224,2.5K,226,"Dear family and friends, this is Doug and Noelle McBrideWe are all deeply affected by the tragic and shocking passing of our beloved Ben. Everyone who had the blessing of meeting him, even those who only knew him for a brief time, remember his great smile, wonderful laugh, hilarious sense of humor, strong testimony, and dedication as a true friend. The light he brought to us all and the spot he fills in each of our hearts cannot be filled.Our family is overwhelmed by the immediate outpouring of love, support and shared grief from family, friends, the Duvall community, and even Ben's new friends from college, many of who we may never get the chance to meet. At every turn we are lovingly asked, ""What do you need?"" with simultaneous genuine offers? of ""We're here to help in any way we can!""?The answer is, understandably what we really want, none of you are able to give us. That is where our faith in Jesus Christ and knowledge that we'll see our Ben again sustains us second by second, which will eventually turn to minute by minute, then hour to hour, day to day, month to month...But I can tell you from experience you never really get over it. You never stop grieving. It becomes a part of you, strengthens you, and is part of why we're here in this earthly experience we're all sharing. I'm still grieving for the loss of my first wife, Kimberly. And I know Ben was certainly still grieving the loss of his mom too.So having gone through this unthinkable process twice now, I'll give my first raw and probably unexpected response to the question of ""Doug, what can I do for you? "" What you can do for me is sit down and decide, document and communicate your wishes for your own final arrangements / funeral with your own loved ones. (Please don't send a copy to me. I've got enough on my plate, thanks. )?- If you're a young high school or college aged student who thinks you'll live forever (which you won't), I'll give you a pass for now but your assignment is instead to call up your parents and ask them to document their wishes so you know what they want.-If you're married and busy raising your family, have that discussion with your spouse and write it down, or update your will, so that your family knows what you want.?- And if you're over 50, you have no excuse. Plan the whole thing. Pick your cemetery and buy your plot. Write out your funeral program.??This undoubtedly will seem like an odd request, but I'm telling you from my own experience, it was a singular emotional lifesaver in my own unexpected time of crisis. Just months before Kimberly passed away, she and I discussed these same uncomfortable issues, so thankfully I didn't have the additional stress of trying to guess what she wanted on top of everything else our family needed at that time.?If you procrastinate this unpleasant task, which everybody knows nobody wants to do, you are relegating your loved ones to make those decisions in your absence on their darkest day. Noelle and I have been blessed with probably the best possible support network of an incredible family, church, community and friends. Even in these best of circumstances, organizing an unexpected funeral is the hardest thing I've ever done. And now I've done it twice.So what you can do lighten our burden? Lighten the inevitable burden of your own immediate family by deciding and documenting what you would want if our situation were yours. Your plans might change, but at least create your Plan A.I apologize for the unexpected soapbox, which is certainly not the point of this webpage, but right now that is our real and honest answer to each of your collective plea ""Doug and Noelle, what can we do for you?"" Please do this for your own loved ones.?OK, a deep breath for me, and after you've done that first step, you can keep reading:?At the suggestion of several kind friends as an attempt to respond to the many of you who are wanting to offer help in whatever way you can, we've somewhat reluctantly set up this GoFundMe campaign for anyone? near or far to contribute whatever they would like towards Ben's funeral expenses.? We are not asking for any specific amount. GoFundMe requires that we list a target goal, which we've simply set at 2001, the year our son Ben was born. Anything left over after meeting our family's own needs will be donated towards helping other struggling youth in the Duvall community. There is a great need there as well, which others in our community have addressed much more adequately than I am able to now.?One last way to help: Another prized keepsake after Kimberly's passing was a book of people's memories and experiences from anyone who wished to contribute (which many of you lovingly did). This memory book is filled with hundreds of stories we had never heard, many from people we've never met, and is now a treasured keepsake to our family. Please help us capture your own fond memories and fun adventures with Ben by sending your own story to [email redacted]. Please include your name and how you know Ben so that in future needful days, which will surely come, we can look back on these shared memories and remember our dear son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin and friend who we all miss so much. There is no frantic rush or deadline to be a part of this effort, as we know everyone is busy. Entries can make it into this memorial book for Ben over the next month or two.?Also, funeral arrangements and timing are still being discussed with immediate family, and will be communicated shortly.?Words can hardly express the gratitude and love Noelle and I feel for all the love and support you continue to extend to our family. Thank you for mourning with those of us who are mourning, and comforting those of us who so desperately are in need? of comforting right now.?With love,Doug and Noelle McBride and family",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose is to give LGBTQIA, as well as marginalized folx a safe space to dance, create, perform, and support one another. We regularly host some of the Raleigh's best drag performances, live music acts, community events, DJ sets, and dance parties.Due to the recent pandemic, we've been forced to postpone events and are operating at a much smaller capacity. Small businesses and events dedicated to queer and marginalized groups are getting hit the hardest right now, because of our of self-selected, minority market. Additionally, our bar is owned and operated by regular community members and queer folx like you and me. We don't come from big money, or have the access to a lot of the extra funds that other mainstream bars and venues do.We are already being forced to cut pay for our employees and performers, many of whom do not have additional income to support them. If this continues we are facing the heartbreaking reality that we may even have to close our doors.Our initial goal will allow us to pay rent and provide staff with income for a few weeks. Please consider donating what you would spend at the bars during these challenging times to help us meet our goal. We promise that if we get through this, our events are going to be more poppin' then ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Magic plays and playwrights have received numerous awards, including the MacArthur Genius Award to Taylor Mac.??And many playwrights whose works have been produced are truly ?part of the Magic family, nurtured through the Virgin Play Festival.

Wir haben uns entwickelt und die Location vergr√∂?ern k√∂nnen, weil Ihr uns dazu inspiriert habt, Eure W√ºnsche waren unsere Agenda. Zahlreiche Paare haben dort zusammengefunden, viele Erinnerungen wurden geschaffen. Die Zeit einer Krise schafft auch immer wieder ""weise"" Ratschl√§ge, von vermeintlichen Unternehmensberatern, die gestern noch Virologen und zwei Monate vorher noch Th√ºringer Wahlexperten waren, die von R√ºcklagen redeten, die wir jedoch kaum bilden konnten, die unsererseits reinvestiert wurden, um mit Euch zu wachsen. Um R√ºcklagen im klassischen Sinne √ºberhaupt definieren zu k√∂nnen, m√ºsste man den Zeitraum des Totalausfalls definieren, den kennen wir nicht, so dass die aktuelle Situation ein Spiel auf Zeit ist. Die einzige fixe Gr√∂?e, die aktuell definierbar ist sind monatliche Zahlungen, die knapp √ºber 13.000 Euro liegen, dem kein einziger Cent an Einnahmen gegen√ºberstehen.Inwiefern und vor allem wann wir von Seiten des Staates Hilfe bekommen und wie lang das Ganze gehen wird wei? ebenfalls niemand. Sicher ist nur, dass wir in den n√§chsten Wochen und Monaten kein Geld einnehmen k√∂nnen. Wir stehen ratlos da und wissen nicht mehr weiter.Wir sorgen uns. Um unsere Oper, um unser Team und um eine R√ºckzugsoase f√ºr unsere G√§ste, die bei uns die Masken des Alltags ablegen konnten. Wir bangen mit unserem Team, unserer Family, um unsere Zukunft und um unser Wohnzimmer, wo wir all die Jahre so viel Herzblut und Energie reingesteckt haben.Wir erhalten viel Zuspruch und Durchhalteparolen von unseren Stammg√§sten, unseren Mitbewohnern, die uns Tag f√ºr Tag ein L√§cheln ins Gesicht zaubern und auch fragten, wie man uns helfen k√∂nnte. Aktuell ist es so, dass wir ein Spiel auf Zeit spielen, jeder Tag ohne Einnahmen ist ein Tag n√§her an einer m√∂glichen Insolvenz. Wir haben an dieser Stelle einen Spendenfond eingerichtet. Jeder Euro kann uns nun √ºber die n√§chsten Monate bringen und uns letztendlich vor der Insolvenz retten.Bis wir unsere Pforten wieder f√ºr Euch √∂ffnen d√ºrfen, bleibt zuhause und bleibt gesund. Auch wenn wir den Drang, sich nun in Gruppen privat zu treffen, verstehen k√∂nnen macht es Sinn, sich an die Empfehlungen der Regierung zu halten. So √ºberwinden wir die Krise schnellstm√∂glich.

We, also, want to make sure that our prices are fair and affordable for everyone. In our efforts to meet the standards, we've developed this ticketing system to ensure that it's a win win for everyone.Here's how it works...CAMPAIGN:We've set our GoFundMe donation minimum to $100 per person, the cost of an early bird ticket. If we are able to raise, at least, $10,000 by March 1st, the event is a go! You can contribute more, if you like, but it's not necessary. The event costs more than $10,000 to put together however, at that point we will feel confident that all of the major expenses will be covered by the event date.If we do not reach our goal, unfortunately, there will not be an event this year, but no need to worry, for with your help, we WILL reach our goal as always! At $100 per person, we only need 100 people to buy early bird tickets. NOTE: All donations are fully refundable until May 1st!If you want to purchase tickets for others, simply, multiply the $100 (minimum donation amount) by the amount of tickets you want to purchase. Then, leave the names of the, additional, ticket holders in the comments section.**Note:? If you purchase through the GoFundMe campaign, your names will be on the will call list at the gate. Be sure to bring a photo ID to pick up your tickets at the event.TICKETS AFTER THE CAMPAIGN:We will have tickets available online via Ticket Leap after the campaign ends, however, the price will be at $125 until the event, then increasing to $150 at the gate. We encourage everyone to purchase your ticket(s) early to aid in reaching our goal and to take advantage of the lower price.? Most festivals of this kind are much more - take advantage! :)RESERVING ROOMS & RV SPACES:The rooms, cabins, and RV spaces will be on hold until the end of our campaign.

Due to hxstoric systematic racism in the housing system (i.e. redlining & The Homestead Act of 1862), they have been denied access to property and financial well-being their entire life. Uhuru has experiences being unsheltered and on Section 8 housing throughout their life. They've stayed with a variety of family members, lived in motels, vehicles and other vulnerable situations.?Uhuru was displaced from their last living situation in Los Angeles and, as their health was simultaneously declining, needed to find an immediate, more affordable place to live. They drove their?Black Magic School Bus?to New Orleans, where they reside today. ??Living with Myasthenia GravisUhuru was diagnosed with Myasthenia Gravis (MG) at the age of 7 (making them a 'one-in-a-million'), a disease that normally effects people over the age of 40. They spent extensive time in intensive care units growing up, on feeding tubes and in hospital beds. Uhuru had multiple surgeries for MG, resulting in recurring long-term healing processes. At times when they were able to leave the hospital, the medical system required them to be on medication and in constant contact with a neurologist.Uhuru lived through their 20s and early 30s with their MG in relapse, self-medicating as needed. The disease has made its way back and Uhuru is currently experiencing a loss of abilities, at a rapid state. Uhuru is currently wheelchaired /paraplegic. In addition, Uhuru is a trans being, whose transition is now on hold, as they now must navigate their MG. The need for hospitalization is imminent.Uhuru's mom is a poor, Black woman, navigating her own struggles, who just moved from Arizona to New Orleans, to take care of Uhuru. Their mom was working two jobs as an essential worker, trying to save money amidst the COVID-19 crisis, putting her own body on the line each day. Her relocation was urgent and she is now recouping the costs of moving across the country. Uhuru's mum is caretaking for Uhuru. They are not receiving aid from The State.Uhuru continuously uses their platform to confront these realities and struggles, on personal and systemic levels.?""Addressing housing for the disabled is a need and a right, not an option""?-Uhuru""Black people are constantly experiencing violence from; being displaced to being violently attacked by white civilians and police with no consequences to follow. A Black life on the street is a life at risk in a fascist state.""?- UhuruTHE UHURU DREAM HOUSEUhuru dreams to create ?a Safe Art House for Black, queer, trans & intersex beings. Within that space there will be a library, garden, meditation room, sauna/spa, computer room, music studio, film studio, art studio, gym, dance studio, room and board.?Uhuru would like to leave the door open to all Black Indigenous beings to come to create or for transitional housing for those who are unsheltered: A SAFE HOUSE.In the midst of being on bed rest last month, Uhuru located housing for themself and negotiated with the owner of the property an agreement to accept a $1,500 intent-to-buy deposit and minimum appraisal amount of $150,000 to purchase the home. From this home they have already BEGUN HOUSING FOLX IN NEED.

D√§umchen drehen ist einfach nicht unser Ding, also haben wir die GOLDGRUBE auf links gedreht und dabei ein paar sehr sch√∂ne Verbesserungen und Instandhaltungen durchgef√ºhrt.Wir wurden oft gefragt, ob wir Fotos vom Baufortschritt in den sozialen Netzwerken posten k√∂nnen. Allerdings w√ºrden wir euch bei der Er√∂ffnung nach Corona gerne damit √ºberraschen und posten daher keine Bilder. Auch wenn sich einiges getan hat, werdet ihr eure GOLDGRUBE aber auf jeden Fall wiedererkennen.Freut euch drauf!!Einen kleinen Einblick in unsere Arbeit gibt dieses Video aus dem Sommer:Mediathek Hessen GOLDGRUBE?Wir hatten gehofft im sp√§ten Herbst oder Winter wieder aufmachen zu d√ºrfen.Aufgrund des erneuten Lockdowns wurde daraus leider nichts und wir wissen selbst nicht, wann wir erneut √∂ffnen d√ºrfen.Trotz der vielen Unklarheiten, haben wir das ganze Jahr an einem coolen Programm gearbeitet. Es h√§tte ein super Jahresende werden k√∂nnen....leider musste das alles wieder verschoben werden.

Wir hoffen eure Vorfreude ist so gro? wie unsere!Unser Plan ist es, im neuen Jahr unter Einhaltung der Hygienebestimmungen, mit dem Barbetrieb zu starten. Leider gehen wir davon aus, dass es vor M√§rz/April/Mai keinen Konzertbetrieb geben wird. Vor allem nicht so, wie wir das bisher kannten und liebten. Wir versuchen uns ein paar neue Konzepte auszudenken, um auch diese Zeit zu √ºberbr√ºcken. Wir sehen es als Chance und vielleicht etablieren sich dadurch neue Formate.Wir haben sehr viel aus eigener Tasche in das Weiterleben der GOLDGRUBE gesteckt. Es gab eure Hilfe, Unterst√ºtzung von der Stadt Kassel, sowie von Bund und Land Hessen.Einige Programme gingen leider auch an uns vorbei, da die GOLDGRUBE nebenberuflich betrieben wird und die Hilfsprogramme nur f√ºr Hauptberufliche vorgesehen sind.Wenn ihr wollt und aufgrund der Pandemie noch selbst in der Lage dazu seid, k√∂nnt ihr uns mit dieser Kampagne helfen und das Weiterleben der GOLDGRUBE unterst√ºtzen!F√ºr s√§mtliche bisher stattgefundene Hilfe und alle eure neue Unterst√ºtzung, bedanken wir uns von ganzem Herzen bei euch!!Bleibt gesund und passt auf euch!

But as the saying goes ... postponed is not canceled!With very few exceptions, every event has been postponed to the next year.Then there are the newly planned concerts ... it will be cool when we can again !!Our plan is to start the bar in the new year. We assume that there will be no concerts before March / April / May. Especially not in the way we know and love so far. We will come up with a few new concepts to bridge this period as well. We see it as an opportunity and maybe this will establish new formats, we'll see.We have put a lot out of our own pockets into the continued existence of the GOLDGRUBE. There was your help, support from the city of Kassel as well as from the federal and state levels of Hessen.Unfortunately some programs also passed us by, because the GOLDGRUBE is operated on a part-time basis and the auxiliary programs are only intended for full-time employees.If you want, you can help and support us with this campaign!We ask you to help us once again on this way.Most of the way seems to have been taken.

Last September, Leah, Sam and the boys went on a free week-long trip to Michigan, paid for by The Little Pink Houses of Hope. There they met several other families dealing with the exact same things that they were. It was so comforting to be around people with the same fears, challenges, hopes, and dreams. In Michigan, they found a new family--their ?úLittle Pink Family?? Leah wanted people to donate to Little Pink Houses of Hope in lieu of funeral services when she passed.

And, she has become the Chief Correspondent for all news, celebrating the accomplishments of others and tenderly sharing the moments of sorrow. ??Once FCFRD responded to its last call, Penny transitioned to the City of South Fulton Fire Rescue Department and continued to positively impact the careers of many. Her most recent assignment has been with the City of South Fulton HR team. ?She was transferred from the fire department because her highly regarded qualities and skills were immediately recognized by the City management team.?Hopefully, we all can come together to celebrate Penny with a good ol' fashioned fire station retirement dinner after this COVID-19 event. ?For now you can celebrate her and show your love by supporting a dream that she has shared over the years. ? That dream is to take a sightseeing road trip with her husband David along the east coast. ?Also, Penny enjoys woodworking. ?Where does she find the time...? ?I am sure she will purchase the latest tool to add to her ever-growing workshop.?I hope you will support this fitting gift for a wonderful person and friend who had the utmost respect for firefighters and believed that her job was to make life a little easier for all of us. ?In her own words, as written in the FCFRD 25th anniversary yearbook, she stated: My role here has always been in a support capacity, assisting our members in whatever their needs may be. ? Now, when I think back to times when I have helped someone, at the end of our conversation when they say ""thank you"" and I say ""my pleasure""...it really has been. ?Though Penny never donned bunker gear and fought fire beside you, she was an essential part of the team (family) who was always ready to help. ?It is now our time to appropriately welcome her to the D-Shift. ??Let's meet or exceed the goal!!!The total amount will be presented to Penny on July 16th or 17th (her last day in the office). Feel free to pass this info to anyone who you think will want to participate. But, LET'S KEEP THIS A SECRET, do not use old mass emails or post to social media because she may be a part of the group.

Life is great! Unbeknownst to you, your last gig would be alongside the official DJ of the Miami Heat, DJ Irie and the City of Miami Beach for what would have been a Spring Break concert series for the history books. Then, in what seemed like the blink of an eye, your entire world shuts down. Restaurants and bars close, hotels and night clubs lock their doors. Enter the era of Covid-19. This is the story of Rahsaan ""DJ Fly Guy"" Alexander. Having amassed a 10-year career as the ?úhigh energy Rahsaan made a name for himself in the South Florida entertainment industry. With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Rahsaan?ôs career had taken a devastating blow. As we closed out the first month of quarantine, a scary reality began to set in; he may never return to DJ in the beloved clubs and bars on Miami Beach. Depression and anxiety were only two of many different emotions that affected the mental health and stability of Rahsaan.? He knew that he would need to pivot, but challenges presented themselves at every turn and he questioned whether he would be able to continue to provide the soundtrack of the iconic Miami nightlife.?In a moment of solitude and deep inflection, Rahsaan made a decision that would ultimately change the course of the remainder of his year. He charged himself with the task of reigniting the zest and enthusiasm he once had for an old love of his, photography. In this same moment another clear and finite decision was made. He would need to take the money he had saved and invest it in redeveloping and refining his once suppressed passion for this creative art form.This pivotal moment quickly went from taking photos for leisure to intentionally capturing moments in time within the city he calls home, Miami. To further his new passion project, Rahsaan has now decided to debut his photojournalist artwork at an exhibition event in December 2020. He is asking for your financial assistance to make this dream come true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1025,Beta Gamma Alumni Step Up for UCLA Fall Rush,"Created September 10, 2020",Celebrations & Events,"$10,551 ","$10,000 ",46,72,46,"UCLA DELTA SIGMA PHI ALUMNI BROTHERS:? the momentum of the Beta Gamma chapter is undeniable.? Last year, we had the biggest fall pledge class in history.? When campus was effectively shut down by Covid last spring, our chapter still managed to identify, rush and pledge six new members -- online!? They did it with determination, effort and a little ""secret sauce.""The secret sauce was provided by the Alumni Control Board.? Specifically, the ACB agreed to fund the initiation fees charged by National and the chapter for new members.? Thus, young men who wanted to join (we used to call them ""rushees"") were able to tell their families that they could join a fraternity without incurring any upfront costs. When all was said and done, the new member feedback to the chapter was that the sponsored initiation fees was a difference-maker in the decision to join the house.ALUMNI OPPORTUNITY NUMBER ONE:? This fall, the ACB is getting tight on funds. It is not in a position to cover the $474 per person in new member fees as it did in the spring.? That's where we come in.??Your involvement can really make a difference.??Will you provide the chapter with $474 to cover the costs of a single new member?? We hope to have ten or more new members join us, so we?ôre looking for at least $4,740 here.Regardless of what other UCLA fraternities are doing, Beta Gamma will rush, and rush aggressively.? The actives need to network and reach out to prospects with a strong message.? The difficulty of the challenge will be compounded because the IFC is not providing fraternities with a list of freshmen men interested in fraternities.? ?Also, UCLA has drastically reduced the number of students living in the dorms.? With Covid, most rooms at 620 Landfair are for two guys.? At this time, we have 18 actives planning to live in the house for fall. ?This leaves 5-8 unused beds in the house that could be offered to new members.? Chapter Advisor Preston Briggs and ACB Chair David Gonzalez believe there are many students who will want to get away from home to live in the UCLA area. ?This brings us to . . . ALUMNI OPPORTUNITY NUMBER TWO:? Preston Briggs, David Gonzalez and I would like to see if the alumni could fund one or more new member rooms for the fall quarter only at no cost to the student.? The per person quarterly rent is $2,490.? So, we are looking to gather as many multiples of $2,490 as possible. ?Our actives have proven they know how to rush.? Can we count on you for $100, $250, $500 or $1,000 to reward their hard work and get this program rolling?? As with the new member fees, we believe the housing offer will prove very attractive.? In the long run, Beta Gamma will reap the benefits, as it preserves momentum and continues to grow at a time when other houses are losing members.? Thank you, and YITBOS!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not many may know this, but Lando spent many years as a teacher in the Philippines, Palau, and New Jersey. He obtained his college education doing all kinds of odd jobs in exchange fo free tuition and school expenses. Always handy with a tool, he was dependable and was relied upon by his friends and family for assistance, which he graciously offered at any chance he got. He was a man of few words, a strong and silent type. Whatever he needed to convey was said not with words, but communicated warmly through his smile and? big heart. Though when he did speak, his words were filled with wisdom; proof of a full, well- traveled life, and a lifelong commitment to education. He was generous and kind offering his food to a total stranger he met at the Emergency Room of the hospital where he was passed on. In his passing, he taught us his final lesson... how to be loved and remembered, for he truly will remain alive in our hearts forever.

What you might not know is that he has served as ED as a volunteer for many of those years - donating his time, energy, and brilliance to the organization.Throughout his two decades of involvement with RCFL, PK has deeply impacted the Harrison Neighborhood in North Minneapolis, the broader Twin Cities Lutheran Community, and almost everyone who walks through Redeemer?ôs doors. With his gentle demeanor and fierce passion for justice, PK has touched the hearts and minds of countless program participants, staff members, and supporters. Although he and Cheryl have no biological children of their own, many call them ?úMom and Dad??because they make everyone feel a part of the Redeemer Family. PK has cultivated a safe space where everyone belongs and everyone can grow.?He transformed so many lives and the community at large as a volunteer ED. Therefore, we are asking for donations to give him an honorarium. No amount of money can equate to the massive impact he?ôs had, but we would like to honor the Chatman?ôs with this financial gift, as a small token of our communal gratitude. Please donate before the end of June, as he leaves at the end of this month.Additionally, please email Bex with your thanks, acknowledgements, and whatever else you want PK to know as he departs from RCFL.

For DivBookFest our mission is to invite diverse authors and readers while providing a safe space. We know that these communities are bearing a disproportionate personal burden during these hard times. Therefore, we believe the inability to provide a guaranteed safe environment this year would be an unnecessary additional stressor. While we did consider making the event virtual for our first year, we decided that postponement of the full event is best at this time as we also had the mission of partnering with Chicago organizations and educators to celebrate the diversity of that vibrant city.?NOTE: All donations are tax deductible through our NonProfit, Our Voice Alliance. Tax receipts will be sent via ""Thank You"" messages on this platform. For a more formal receipt, please email [email redacted].We are planning a kidlit book festival that showcases diverse voices and celebrates their stories! We want to create an accessible and open space to celebrate stories written by authors from marginalized backgrounds who tell stories about underrepresented characters.Our hope is that this event will allow readers from these marginalized groups see themselves in stories, and take pride in their identities, while also building greater empathy and understanding from their allies. Panel discussions will go beyond the basics of diversity in publishing and children's literature and show that we are not a monolith.The first inaugural DivBookFest will be held in Chicago, IL - a vibrant and beautifully diverse city with an active literary community. This is a perfect place to bring people together from all backgrounds to celebrate and promote diversity and equity in children?ôs literature!Event MissionBring together book lovers in a festival centered around celebrating diverse voices and marginalized experiencesEvent Goals- Help young people celebrate their diverse identities through stories and books- Showcase books from marginalized voices*- Illuminate authors from backgrounds historically underrepresented in publishing- Open the conversation about diversity*?- Create a space to celebrate diversity*- Bring authentic diverse stories to readers from marginalized backgrounds*adopted from the DVPit definition of diversity: We recognize all diverse identities and experiences including (but not limited to): Native peoples and people of color; people living and/or born/raised in underrepresented cultures and countries; disabled persons (including neurodiverse); people on marginalized ends of the cultural and/or religious spectrum; people identifying within LGBTQIA+; and more.(Note: while DivBookFest is supported by #dvpit it is not directly affiliated or run by dvpit)Your support will help the festival:- Spread the word about this event?- Cover travel expenses for panelists and volunteers^?- Account for venue/location costs- Cover domain and website administrative costs- Cover the cost of supplies- Any overflow funding will go toward future festivals, prizes/swag for attendees, and extra programming such as sending authors out for school visits!*We're partnering with Our Voice Alliance to make your charitable contribution tax deductible!*^One of the things we've seen and learned is that lack of invitation is not the only barrier to diverse authors attending festivals. Another factor is lack of resources, accessibility, and funds. So one of our biggest goals is to fundraise enough to completely cover the travel expenses for all attending creators!If you'd like to be a sponsor of the festival please reach out to us at [email redacted]For more information:http://www.divbookfest.com/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He met many people of different beliefs and religions: Muslims, Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Buddhists, Hindus, and New Age believers. For example through him, over 10,000 people in North America have entered Islam and have taken initiation in the Naqshbandi Order.One of the dear mureeds of Sheikh Nazim is our beloved Sheikh Hassan Dyck. Sheikh Hassan has been appointed as the wakil, the deputy of Europe. He established in 1995 the OSMANISCHE HERBERGE as the center of Europe.We try our best to visit the Sheikh monthly for the big dhikr. Traveling from all corners of Europe to enter a place of warm welcomes and smiles, a special place to reconnect our heart to Allah The Most Merciful. We eat together, pray together, listen to sohbet together, make dhikr together and release all our energy with hadrah together.The OSMANISCHE HERBERGE in Kall is the place where the brothers meet the other brothers and the sisters meet the other sisters. Young, old, white, black, yellow and in between. All of them experience a sense of cleaning every dhikr they attend and many of them are so grateful to being able to have their dead hearts revived and reconnected to Allah the Most High.Since 25 years the OSMANISCHE HERBERGE - located 1 hour West of Cologne in the Eifel - is a house of open door and spiritual teaching in the tradition of a Sufi Dergah. A place where you can always get a free meal. A place where our dear Sheikh Hassan, brothers and sisters are ready to help you with any worldly or spiritual problem you are facing.The OSMANISCHE HERBERGE is facing a problem and needs your help urgently!The local building authorities oblige us due to new laws and regulations to extensive construction measures, which correspond to the fire safety and other legal regulations.To implement all the required measures, we need approx. ??80,000. These include e.g. the installation of fire protection doors, the partial conversion of the roof at the front and rear as an emergency exit, and complete renewal and relocation of the main power distributor, to name just the larger measures.We ask you dear brother and sister in humanity. We ask you dear brother and sister in Islam help us. Help us and may Allah shower you with immense blessings. Help us for the sake of our shared love of the Prophet Muhammad saws. Help us and may Allah always surround you with the sadiqeen, the trustworthy ones, His Friends, and be in good company for eternity. Amin ya Rabbil Alameen.Please remember the words of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (saws May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated by Uthman bin Affan (may Allah be pleased with him).Uthman bin Affan narrated that:he heard Allah's Messenger say: ""Whoever builds a Masjid for (the sake of) Allah, then Allah will build a similar house for him in Paradise.""ÿ≠?ÿØ??ÿ´???ÿß ÿ®???ÿØ?ÿßÿ±?? ÿ≠?ÿØ??ÿ´???ÿß ÿ£?ÿ®?? ÿ®???ÿ±? ÿß??ÿ≠????????? ÿ≠?ÿØ??ÿ´???ÿß ÿπ?ÿ®?ÿØ? ÿß??ÿ≠????ÿØ? ÿ®??? ÿ¨?ÿπ???ÿ±?? ÿπ??? ÿ£?ÿ®????? ÿπ??? ??ÿ≠????ÿØ? ÿ®??? ??ÿ®??ÿØ?? ÿπ??? ÿπ?ÿ´???ÿß?? ÿ®??? ÿπ????ÿß??? ??ÿß?? ÿ≥???ÿπ?ÿ™? ÿß????ÿ®???? ÿµ?? ÿß??? ÿπ??? ?ÿ≥?? ??????? ??""?????? ÿ®???? ??????? ??ÿ≥?ÿ¨?ÿØ?ÿß ÿ®???? ÿß?????? ???? ??ÿ´????? ??? ÿß??ÿ¨????ÿ©? ??????????ÿß?? ????? ÿß??ÿ®?ÿßÿ®? ÿπ??? ÿ£?ÿ®?? ÿ®???ÿ±? ??ÿπ???ÿ±? ??ÿπ?????? ??ÿπ?ÿ®?ÿØ? ÿß?????? ÿ®??? ÿπ???ÿ±?? ??ÿ£???ÿ≥? ??ÿßÿ®??? ÿπ?ÿ®??ÿßÿ≥? ??ÿπ?ÿßÿ¶?ÿ¥?ÿ©? ??ÿ£???? ÿ≠?ÿ®??ÿ®?ÿ©? ??ÿ£?ÿ®?? ÿ∞?ÿ±?? ??ÿπ???ÿ±?? ÿ®??? ÿπ?ÿ®?ÿ≥?ÿ©? ????ÿßÿ´???ÿ©? ÿ®??? ÿß?ÿ£?ÿ≥???ÿπ? ??ÿ£?ÿ®?? ??ÿ±???ÿ±?ÿ©? ??ÿ¨?ÿßÿ®?ÿ±? ÿ®??? ÿπ?ÿ®?ÿØ? ÿß?????? ??????ÿß?? ÿ£?ÿ®?? ÿπ??ÿ≥?? ÿ≠?ÿØ??ÿ´? ÿπ?ÿ´???ÿß?? ÿ≠?ÿØ??ÿ´? ÿ≠?ÿ≥??? ÿµ?ÿ≠??ÿ≠? ????????ÿ≠????ÿØ? ÿ®??? ??ÿ®??ÿØ? ??ÿØ? ÿ£?ÿØ?ÿ±??? ÿß????ÿ®???? ÿµ?? ÿß??? ÿπ??? ?ÿ≥?? ????ÿ≠????ÿØ? ÿ®??? ÿß?ÿ±??ÿ®??ÿπ? ??ÿØ? ÿ±?ÿ£?? ÿß????ÿ®???? ÿµ?? ÿß??? ÿπ??? ?ÿ≥?? ??????ÿß ÿ∫??ÿß???ÿß?? ÿµ?ÿ∫??ÿ±?ÿß?? ??ÿØ??????ÿß?? ???èReference: Jami` at-Tirmidhi 318", In-book reference: Book 2, Hadith 170, Vol. 1, Book 2, Hadith 318If you want to donate directly with a bank transfer, please visit our website: Bank Information.How your Donations will help the OSMANISCHE HERBERGEYour generous donations are collected by Ahmad Adamek, the Treasurer of the OSMANISCHE HERBERGE.

We have now concluded Beyond 45 through GoFundMe. Please see our update below. If you would like to receive future updates and stories from AIM AIR, please Sign Up here.?----------------------------------------This year COVID-19 took a toll on AIM AIR. Our normal flight schedule dropped to half of our budgeted amount, resulting in losses of about $25,000 per month. Despite financial reserves that initially offset our monthly losses, we are projecting a $100,000 shortfall in our Operations Fund by the end of the year.Established 45 years ago in 1975, AIM AIR has been using aviation in East and Central Africa to help missionaries and the local church go beyond the end of the road. Many Africa Inland Mission (AIM) missionaries serve in extremely isolated, remote, and often insecure areas among people that have little exposure to, or understanding of, the Good News. Using aircraft has allowed us to keep missionary communities connected to the rest of the world.When we look ?úBeyond 45??years of ministry we believe God will continue to have a purpose for AIM AIR. There is still a need for safe and reliable aviation support within AIM and the church in East and Central Africa. We have the tools and desire to offer our support as a lifeline to those living in remote and isolated areas for years to come.We need your help. The ?úBeyond 45"" campaign will ensure the survival of AIM AIR. As the 2020 shortfall is met we are eager to begin reducing our flight costs to AIM missionaries ??now more isolated than ever because of COVID travel restrictions. Funds will then transition to covering some of the fixed costs of AIM AIR, significantly lowering the cost of our flights into the future.While Beyond 45 is primarily about outlasting this pandemic, we hope you also see it as the beginning of a new opportunity to better support missionaries and the church in East and Central Africa. Let?ôs go Beyond 45 together and see what God has planned.Will you go Beyond 45 with us and be a lifeline?All funds given to AIM through this GoFundMe campaign will go towards the AIM AIR Operations fund - a project of Africa Inland Mission.?Interested in giving by check or other means or becoming a monthly investor?

Most of the excavation and parking lot grading, permits and designs were completed in 2018 and 2019. Actual construction started in early 2020 and continued with the hope that our generous Sikh Sangat from all over the world will help us complete the fundraising goal. Then COVID 19 situation presented another challenge.At present:1. Almost 750,000 has been spent on construction, out of which 250,000 are still owing to contractors and suppliers who are threatening to put lean on the Gurdwara building.2. We have approached multiple banks for construction loan but has been denied by three major banks so far based on previous years income, which was limited and currently zero because the gurdwara is closed. Also, the current economic situation is adding to the bank?ôshesitation.3. We approached a few wealthy Sikh philanthropists, but no positive response so far.4.

We offer facilities for daily prayers, jummah and regular events and seminars. We carry out interfaith work, youth and community engagement and have close working relationships with partners in the NHS, Police and Fire services.?Our building is old, in a poor state of repair with bowing walls, damaged roofs, leaks and dry rot. Despite the difficulties our current building causes, we are at full capacity and so are no longer able to expand our services, meeting the ever increasing demand nor fit our activities into our current space. It is not financially viable to continue to spend thousands of pounds every year on repairing and maintaining a building which is not fit for purpose and can't meet the community's future needs.Our vision is to redevelop our site, creating a modern Masjid and community Centre. This would allow us to make use of space which currently houses single storey buildings to create a full 4 storey building which is future proof and fit to meet the growing needs of our community. It would give us more than double the amount of space that we currently have.?We can't do this on our own.

If your great-grandfather built the house you lived in, only to have a neighbor burn it down - what would you do to make sure that his new house stood forever?You'd feel a personal connection. Just as you would if you know Mable Clarke. We are called to preserve a piece of history, and ask that you join us.?---------------------------------------------------THE MISSION:Help us SUPPORT MABLE CLARKE's EFFORTS TO SAVE Soapstone Baptist Church and Slave Cemetery located near Pickens, in Pumpkintown. ---------------------------------------------------Mable Clarke and the other 9 church members of Soapstone Church (the first church, founded by freed slaves in the Upstate) have received interests by Florida developers to buy the church?ôs 6 acres. They don?ôt want to sell the property, but the current remaining mortgage sits at $50,000. The church has been able to keep the lights on and remain current through Mable?ôs monthly food fundraisers.THE MORTGAGE IS WITHIN REACH. For decades Mable Clarke has worked tirelessly to keep history alive, for the sake of her heritage and one special promise.?Help us, help her, deliver on that promise.---------------------------------------------------THE PROMISEMable started monthly food fundraisers/cookouts to raise money to keep a deathbed promise to her mother, made at the age of 104 -- to keep the doors of Soapstone Church open and continue her good work. But the mission grew into the discovery and restoration of the slave cemetery that sits on the church grounds. Mable had heard about the cemetery where many of the freed slaves were buried her entire life through family stories, and for decades, no one knew where it was. Those stories came full-circle in the early 2000s when the slave cemetery was discovered by a land surveyor reviewing the property line.Mable felt deeply for the cemetery. These were her ancestors, they were the founders of the town. Most importantly, they were people. They deserved to be recognized. She contacted Pickens County and Clemson University (among others), received a grant, and they cleared the land.---------------------------------------------------THE HISTORYPerseverance and heritage are the backbones of the church. Mable's great grandfather was one of the freed slaves that stayed in the area and would hold service at the giant soapstone rock, which sits next to the church today. In 1967, the Ku Klux Klan burned the original church down. A few years later, they rebuilt and that's the building you'd find today.For the past 10 years, Mable has been hosting monthly fish-fry's as a way to pay the mortgage and keep the utilities running. At $14 a plate, she has also built an amazing community of supporters. Food is her tool, a way to reach people, and a way to bring people together. But it isn't enough.They need you. She needs you.---------------------------------------------------THE ASKWe have known and loved Mable for many years and have a conviction to help. Her story, her family?ôs story and the church?ôs history is incredible. The above information doesn't scratch the surface for how deep-rooted Soapstone Church is in our community. It's a piece of history. One we SHOULD NOT let developers purchase and destroy.?Please help us, help Mable and the members of Soapstone Church by making a contribution that will help pay-off the mortgage.??Thank You!Mable Clarke, Andy Douglas and Friends---------------------------------------------------LEARN MORE?The Fish-Fryhttp://www.soapstonechurch.com/fishfry.htmThe Full Historyhttp://www.soapstonechurch.com/history.htm---------------------------------------------------IN THE NEWSHidden History: Fish Fry Ministry at Soapstone Baptist Church - WSPA TVhttps://www.wspa.com/news/hidden-history-fish-fry-ministry-at-soapstone-baptist-church/One Woman is Using Food to Preserve History - The Greenville News?https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/historical-upstate-churches/2017/02/03/mable-clarke-using-food-soapstone-baptist-church-tool-preserve-black-history/97033094/Soapstone Baptist Church Feeds the Soul of the Community - Livin' Upstatehttps://livingupstatesc.com/soapstone-baptist-church-fish-fry-feeds-the-soul-of-the-community/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, it comes with a very high deductible and a max payout for the policy. Once both of these factors are taken into consideration we will only receive 25-30% of the replacement cost of the trailer and all of its contents. We are heading into summer camp season with no gear and are hoping you can help.Troop 914 was established in 1996 with six Scouts, two tents, and one piece of outdoor cooking equipment. Over those years, our young men worked hard and acquired sleeping bags, cooking equipment, tents and a trailer to haul and house this equipment.In the last 24 years, Troop 914 has created over 60 Eagle Scouts and 10 Eagle Scouts Palms. Our Troop and the overall mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young men to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the scout oath and law. Scouting is a Leadership program, our young scouts have fun camping, working with the community and studying science, medicine, engineering, politics, journalism, business, finance and project management.Our Troop does not have enough funds to replace the equipment without passing this burden onto our young men and their families. All the funds raised will be used to replace the gear and trailer.Whether you are able to give or not, please keep the boys of Troop 914 in your prayers. We continue with our commitment, to help raise a generation of young men that will be leaders in their communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1074,Zonnepanelen ICCW: Sadaka Jariya,"Created April 19, 2020","Missions, Faith & Church","??6,022 ","??00,00",240,222,239,"Goedendag,? As-sal?mu  øalaykum,Laten wij onszelf eerst even voorstellen. Het ICCW is sinds 1981 bezig met het welzijn van haar leden en haar (directe) omgeving. De (religieuze) activiteiten van het ICCW staan in teken van het samenbrengen van de verschillende groepen in onze samenleving.?? Het ICCW heeft als kerntaak het in stand houden en beheren van onze moskee. De kernactiviteiten van het ICCW sluiten hier logischerwijs bij aan. In de eerste plaats is het ICCW opgericht om de islamitische gemeenschap in Woerden een plek te bieden waar zij aan haar?religieuze verplichtingen kunnen voldoen (te weten de vijf dagelijkse gebeden, de vrijdagpreek, de?taraweeh-gebeden in de ramadan, de feestgebeden, het islamitische dodengebed en de vrijwillige gebeden).? Naast bovengenoemde religieuze activiteiten ontplooit het ICCW verschillende activiteiten die in een bredere religieuze context kunnen worden geplaatst. Denk daarbij aan educatieve activiteiten, sociaal-culturele activiteiten, sportieve en recreatieve activiteiten, charitatieve activiteiten en overige maatschappelijke activiteiten. Op o.a. de projectenpagina op onze website (www.iccw.nl/doneer) is een overzicht en beschrijving opgenomen van de lopende projecten.?Het ICCW wilt een inspirerende plek bieden voor alle mensen in en rondom Woerden, ongeacht geloof, afkomst of leeftijd. Ons voornaamste doel is onze gemeenschap en bezoekers kennis op te laten doen, deze voor hen toegankelijk te maken en deze kennis verder te delen.? Er bestaan geen subsidies voor moskee√´n in Nederland. Dit betekent dat de moskee volledig afhankelijk is van haar eigen gemeenschap. Normaliter zouden wij de gezegende maand Ramadan gebruiken om bij onze leden geld in te zamelen voor aanstaande projecten. De Ramadan is dan ook een zeer belangrijke bron van inkomsten voor de moskee. Hiermee zouden wij de geplande projecten kunnen financieren.?? Door de Coronacrisis is het op een ?ònormale??manier inzamelen helaas niet meer mogelijk. Dit betekent niet dat wij bij de pakken neer gaan zitten. Nee, elk tegenslag biedt ook een kans!??Veel mensen binnen onze gemeenschap zijn van mening dat het digitaal collecteren weinig tot geen succes zal hebben. Er wordt aangegeven dat de oude garde in de regel het meeste inzamelt en dat daardoor de gang naar het internet vruchteloos zal zijn. Ik ben er zelf van overtuigd dat het benaderen van de jongere generatie op een laagdrempelige manier juist wel vruchten af zal werpen. Financieel hebben de jongeren het misschien minder, maar dankzij de mogelijkheden van het internet hebben wij een veel grotere pool om uit te putten.? Begrijp ons niet verkeerd, de oude garde (d.w.z. de eerste generatie Marokkaanse gastarbeiders, onze ouders dus) heeft met bloed, zweet en tranen de moskee jaar in jaar uit opgebouwd tot wat het vandaag de dag is. Wij zijn hen dan ook daar zeer dankbaar voor. Nu is het aan de jonge generatie om de volgende stap te maken. De onderliggende vraag is dan ook: zijn jullie bereid en in staat om het stokje over te nemen en de moskee samen met ons verder uit te bouwen?? Wij hebben er zelf alle vertrouwen in en zijn dan ook de uitdaging aangegaan door direct de stoute schoenen aan te trekken. Wij hopen dat wij samen met jong en oud, met behulp van kleine (alles helpt) en grote bijdragen, het volgende project kunnen verwezenlijken:? Wij willen voor de moskee 300 zonnepanelen aanschaffen, in eerste instantie om:? Zelfvoorzienend te zijn (energieneutraal)? Vooruit te lopen op een fossielvrije toekomst? Met de restcapaciteit initiatieven ontplooien i.o.m. gemeente? Teruglevering van energie is een extra bron van inkomsten om de vaste lasten te dekken. (minder afhankelijk van sec. contributie)? Voor een zonnepaneel incl. aansluitstukken gaan wij uit van ??50,-. Donateurs kunnen zelf bepalen hoeveel zij kunnen en/of willen doneren.? Voor degene die een Zonnepaneel ?òop naam??willen kopen, hebben wij het volgende bedacht. Er zal een plaquette (zie voorbeeldfoto binnenkort bij de updates) worden gemaakt met maximaal 300 namen. Dit zijn de namen van de personen die √©√©n of meerdere zonnepanelen hebben gedoneerd. Mocht je meerdere zonnepanelen hebben gedoneerd, zal er achter je naam het aantal komen (x gedoneerd).?? Zo willen wij mensen stimuleren en ook meteen wat terug doen voor degene die een zonnepaneel ?ògeadopteerd??hebben. Hun namen worden hiermee vereeuwigd op de plaquette en op een centrale plek gehangen.?? Inmiddels hebben wij een SDE+ subsidie aangevraagd. Deze is nog niet toegekend. Dit betekent dat wij het bedrag sowieso moeten voor gaan financieren. Als de subsidie toegekend wordt, willen wij het subsidiebedrag gebruiken om verder te vergroenen, denk aan: van het gas af, isolatie, renovatie etc.Wij hopen dat jullie deze actie kunnen waarderen en vooral ook steunen. Ik vraag jullie daarnaast ook om de link veelvuldig te delen zodat de kans groter wordt om ons doel te bereiken.?? Tijdens de Ramadanperiode, zullen er ook live events plaats vinden waarbij wij meer informatie zullen verstrekken en middels interactie mensen aan zullen sporen om te doneren. Blijf hiervoor onze website (www.ICCW.nl/Doneer)onze Facebook kanaal (https://www.facebook.com/islamitischcultureelcentrumwoerden.iccw ) en onze YouTube kanaal (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwWYrngX0gJJhhVhuQ6J6Fg/videos ) in de gaten houden.?Baraka Allahu fiekoum in sha Allah.??ÿß?ÿ≥?ÿß? ÿπ???? ?ÿ±ÿ≠?ÿ© ÿß??? ?ÿ®ÿ±?ÿßÿ™?.? ? ?????ÿ´???

De namen worden op volgorde van donatie (datum) geplaatst", dus wie het eerst komt die het eerst maalt;? De donateurs die meerdere zonnepanelen doneren worden op basis van aantal en vervolgens op volgorde van donatie geplaatst.

Mocht je gedoneerd hebben en later nog een donatie doen, geldt de datum (en aantal) van je eerste donatie voor de plaats op de ranglijst;? Mocht je een donatie willen doen en niet voldoende geld hebben (gefaseerd betalen), dan is dat mogelijk. Neem dan even contact op met het bestuur via [email redacted]?. Je dient dan de eerste (aanbetaling) te voldoen. Deze aanbetalingsdatum geldt als donatiedatum voor de ranglijst. Nadat het streefbedrag behaald is, zal er maximaal 2 maanden gewacht worden op de betalingen van degene die aan hebben gegeven gefaseerd te betalen. Daarna wordt de lijst definitief gemaakt. Indien men nog niet volledig betaald heeft, zal men niet meegenomen worden op de plaquette (uitzonderingen voorbehouden); ? Alleen bestaande (geen verzonnen) namen worden overgenomen op de plaquette;? ICCW houdt zich het recht namen in te korten (i.v.m. lengte) of aan te passen;? Het is mogelijk om een donatie op te geven voor de familie, dan wordt i.p.v. het individu de familienaam geplaatst;? Let goed op bij het opgeven van je naam, deze wordt namelijk 1 op 1 overgenomen;? De plaquette kent een maximum van 300 namen, dit kunnen er minder worden i.v.m. meerdere donaties per persoon, maar niet automatisch meer. Mocht het zo zijn dat er meer dan 300 zonnepaneeldonaties binnen komen, zal het bestuur in overleg met de graveerder kijken wat mogelijk is;? Mocht het binnengekomen donatiegeld het streefdoel voorbijschieten (MashAllah), dan wordt het bedrag dat overblijft in het potje geplaatst van het volgende project (kozijnrenovatie moskee);? Contant doneren is mogelijk, neem daarvoor contact op met het bestuur 06 87 239 979 of mail naar [email redacted]?Er kunnen geen rechten worden ontleend aan het plaatsen van de namen;UPDATEDaarnaast kunnen de mensen die het lastig vinden om via de site te doneren ook middels een open tikkie te doneren.

Haggai 1:8We are in the process of securing a loan and facilitating a down payment on a church building we are planning to purchase by the grace of God. The bank we are working with to secure the loan from has set some preconditions for us to maintain a specified cash flow balance. As a church that relies on the generous donations of its congregation we have to turn to the children of God and request the faithful to generously donate whatever they can as soon as possible.Because the COVID-19 restrictions we have not been able to assemble in church and as a result, donations to our church have been at a very low point for the past several months. The Head of our church, our Father and members of the Parish Council are working hard day and night to successfully finalize the purchase of this church building as soon as possible.Let's remind ourselves that we are where we are today by the grace of God and although what we mere mortals give is not sufficient to the glory of God; we need to do what we can and partake of the blessings of Almighty God.Our bank has advised us to maintain a minimum balance of $150,000, please let's come together and meet this minimum requirement!The bible tells us King David who was favored by God while he was still a shepherd boy, and about who God testified ""I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will."" (Acts 13:22). Although David had a strong desire to build the Temple of God, he was not permitted to do so. The chance was given to his son Solomon. We are chosen like Solomon!Let's remind ourselves the prayer of David (Ps 132:1-5)1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:2 How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,5 Until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.Let's rise up in the spirit of David and purchase our church building!!!By the grace of God, the prayer and beseeching of our Father the Head of our church, the prayer and support of the faithful children of God let's purchase our church building to have a lasting place for the Ark of The Covenant and a place of prayers and refuge for the faithful.The building is to be purchased in the name of our church, for the use of our church and for the benefit of the faithful children of God. Let's rejoice and give with joy for we have received the bounties of God?May the peace of God be upon us allDebre Menkirat Kidus Amanuel & Rufael Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As physical donations are going to remain difficult in the short term due to the current restrictions, the RSRS Centre would therefore be grateful for your continuous support via this online link.The donations provided by yourselves will immediately help us kick start the following projects:Dining hall renovation which includes new tables and heating upgrade.New disabled access ramp to original building.Essential roof maintenance work across various parts.Baby changing facilities in main hall.Toilet upgrades to main hall.We would also like to thank all the volunteers that have continued to maintain the centre over recent months despite the difficult restrictions that have been in place.Yours faithfully?RSRS Centre",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We haven't gone to the store, we just stay here.""Whom does this project serve??We aim to serve the Navajo and Hopi elders in the most remote locations. ?As our capacity grows and our network expands, we will be better able to serve others. ?We are currently servicing 11 communities on the Navajo and Hopi reservations and have delivered over 1000 food boxes since April 15. (see map below in pictures)That being said, we are making an intentional effort to not post images of the elders who receive resources out of respect for their dignity and privacy. Our goal is to empower local leaders in the communities by dropping off boxes of food and supplies, then allowing them to complete the deliveries to the elders whom they engage with on a regular basis. We do post some photos of our local partners who receive the boxes on behalf of the communities they serve.?What's the need?Basically, they need food, PPE and cleaning supplies. ?The elderly are in desperate need of specific items?îincluding food and some household items?îthat will help them remain safe and cared for in their homes during this time.?Why are there so many cases on the Navajo Nation??The Navajo Nation is approximately the size of West Virginia and the Hopi reservation is within its boundaries. Due to the remoteness, 30-40% of the population still lives without running water and electricity. Many also do not have internet access. Family clan systems and cultural norms create communities of interdependency, making it hard to isolate those that are sick from those that are well. High rates of unemployment and overcrowding in reservation residences mean that there is a high potential of entire households catching COVID-19.?During this time, some of the most vulnerable are the elderly. Most communities on the reservation have a Senior Citizen Center, which can provide hot meals to the elderly as well as comfort and support. Normally, these elderly are picked up at their homes and brought to the centers to be cared for. Due to the physical distancing guidelines, they are no longer being brought to these centers. ?How can you help?We hope to service 500 elders every two weeks for the next four months or until things begin to normalize. That's 1,000 food boxes a month for the next four months, a total of 4,000 food boxes. We are looking to raise $160,000.

The fire travelled downward, burning through the entire attic (where the children?ôs room was) to the rest of the back side of the building. Some items were salvageable, but everything else was destroyed. Thankfully, no one was injured and the fire department was quick to the scene. Amidst the pandemic, we have been holding our services on Facebook Live and Zoom while the praise team and pastor were physically at church. However, due to the circumstances, we will have to temporarily hold all of our services and events on Zoom or in another facility. The money that is raised through this GoFundMe will be used to reconstruct the stage, the pastor?ôs office and the children?ôs room. It will also be used to replace any destroyed items such as hymn notes, Bibles, microphones, modems, etc. New Life Baptist Church of Philadelphia has been a place where countless memories were made with both members of the church and friends in the community. Although we are saddened that this has happened, we are grateful that many has stepped up to offer their hands of service however they can, ready to rebuild the church!

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many labourers offered their services, free of charge to aid in renovating Imam Hussain Mosque.

It is our responsibility as the community and youth to ensure our Masjid does not go to ruins. Please use this sacred opportunity to put your money towards a great cause.

1108,Help Elena Pay Stdnt Debt to Enter Religious Life,"Created May 31, 2020","Missions, Faith & Church","$23,245 ","$26,195 ",36,76,36,"The call: To give of myself totally, freely, and joyfully to Jesus Christ by consecrating myself to Him. I desire to be fully His and undivided. I desire to proclaim with my whole life the freedom in Christ which is offered to all and which heals all.The obstacle: $103,000 in student loansThe story: Raised Catholic in a loving family, my eyes were opened to a greater depth of love in my freshman year at Oregon State University when I first encountered the Saint John Society and Society of Mary, missionary religious orders originally from Argentina. During my four years at OSU, I continued to seek a deeper faith in Christ through prayer and service while studying for my undergraduate degree. Since I was little, I have felt the need to try to alleviate the suffering of those around me.? As a I grew older, this need allowed me to see my future as a nurse. After my four years at OSU, I moved to Portland, Oregon to pursue this dream and I graduated with my BSN in August of 2018. After working as an RN for some time, I began to experience a need for something more. I would come home from my shifts, pray, and experience the most subtle sadness.? This sadness confused me because my job was even better than I thought it would be. I loved nursing even more than I thought I would, and even with that, I felt a small sadness. Fast forward some months, I took a trip to walk the Camino de Santiago and to visit Fatima and Rome. I felt a new freedom to abandon my will and repose it in the will of my Father. With this freedom, I opened my heart to listen to the Lord in regards to my vocation. Up until this point, I had always believed I had found my vocation: to be a wife, mother, and nurse. Slowly, the Lord began to change these desires and opened my eyes to the way of life that most makes me alive and utilizes my talents. I began to discern the religious life with the Society of Mary - the group of sisters who evangelized me at 18. Since I began my discernment, I have experienced fulfillment as I had never experienced before. I have more joy, excitement, and love as I look at my life through the vision of this vocation. It is as if every aspect of my life, all the joy and suffering, makes sense in light of this call. This desire, to give of myself completely, totally, fully, and undivided to Jesus Christ and to my brothers and sisters in Him, has always been the root desire in me. As I move forward and answer the Lord with a ""yes"" to the call to be consecrated to Him, I see that the Lord also calls me to retain the most fundamental aspects of nursing and to bring them with me into this new life. As a sister in the Society of Mary, my joy will be to proclaim the healing medicine of Christ, freedom in Him, and Him as the true source of abundant life and hope.?How you can help: First and foremost, I humbly ask for your prayers. I have entrusted this obstacle to the intercession of St. Joseph, and with joy, I accept the will of the Father for me. Second, if you feel called and can support me financially, I am heartily grateful.?Please feel free to contact me with any questions you have, or if you would like to hear more about my story!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1112,Joe & Laurie's Hay House Ministry,"Created August 29, 2020","Missions, Faith & Church","$22,636 ","$50,000 ",60,246,60,"A story of one couple's fight against a life-threatening brain injury, and now stage 4A ovarian cancer, while serving a lifelong ministry for Jesus to build a straw bale house.THE HAY HOUSE MINISTRY: Dream and reality, ""The House that Jesus Built.""Building a Straw Bale House is the culmination of several dreams; Joe and Laurie's dream to build their own house, the dream to build in straw bale, and the dream to use every bit of what they have to help and serve others. The first two are straight forward so let me tell you about the third.Joe is a Pastor. Since beginning in 1994, together Joe and Laurie have ministered in four churches across three denominations, always in small country towns. It is demanding work and, in the country, it can be lonely. Within three years of starting, Joe had burnt out and ministry came to an abrupt end. At that time, doctors were unsure whether Joe would ever be able to return to ministry. Apart from anti-depressants, there was not a lot of help available at that time and recovery was slow and difficult, taking its toll on the whole family. However, finally, Joe eventually began to heal and God sustained him and our family through his recovery. From this experience, the dream was born; to create a place where pastors and missionaries who were at risk of burnout could come to rest, be encouraged, and be restored.?In 2002, Joe and Laurie were able to purchase 164 acres of agricultural land near the tiny town of Popanyinning, a couple of hours drive south of Perth in Western Australia. It took them several years, but they were finally able to transport down a 1930?ôs cottage from Perth which they have partially renovated and live in. It is referred to, affectionately, as ?òthe shack,' meant to be a temporary residence but the home they still live in, to this day.?Doing everything on ?òthe cheap??is a hard and time-consuming path and much time and energy have been put into farm infrastructure and gardens. With plenty still to do, they have established a small, diverse orchard and large organic vegetable area, as well as fencing and sheds, while continuing in ministry in two local churches, and often while also working other jobs. Joe, a man who has always given his best and most in everything he does, has spent many years working up to 3 or more jobs at a time from cleaning to ministry, to see this dream and ministry fulfilled.?Sadly, in late 2009 after caring for her for almost a year, Laurie's mother Roma lost her battle with cancer, just a few years after her husband Bruce lost his own. This was a devastating time for Joe and Laurie, who felt the loss of both of Laurie's parents still quite young, very deeply. By early 2014, Joe and Laurie were able to receive their inheritance from Laurie's parents, through the sale of Roma's home, which finally enabled work to begin on the straw bale home.?The home itself is large, and designed for communal living, but with ample areas for quiet contemplation. It will be a place for sharing. Joe and Laurie have been hands-on builders. Other than those tasks which require tradesmen by law or are totally outside of their ability, they have painstakingly built almost the entire home by hand, from building the frame, laying the straw bales, making the wooden jarrah windows, including the glazing, and finally rendering the walls. The journey has not been without challenges, least of all some serious injuries which threatened to derail the whole dream.?There are three which stand out: First, Laurie fell into a hole while they were building and broke both her leg and her ankle. She spent almost a year recovering from this fall, unable to put a large amount of weight on her leg and spending a lot of time in bed recovering (which, if you know Laurie, is enough to drive her mad). Second, Joe?ôs fall from a ladder, which resulted in a head injury taking another 12 months to return to somewhat normal, and third, Laurie?ôs cancer, their new setback, and challenge.?Joe's fall happened in 2015. As Joe and Laurie were just beginning to clad the roof of the house, Joe fell from a ladder and sustained a serious head injury that threatened his life. Laurie found him unconscious, and he was emergency flown to Perth, where he spent a week in the hospital under careful observation. Joe's head injury was severe; at that time doctors were unsure whether he would recover, and if so, whether he would sustain long term memory loss including the ability to speak, walk and read. Joe spent a long year in recovery, unable to work. But again, God sustained him and while Joe still suffers some long-term effects from his fall, his healing is considered ""miraculous."" Praise Jesus! Joe and Laurie were blessed to have family and friends come to our rescue and over a series of weekends the roof was fully clad for them. Had this not been the case the exposed wooden structure would not have survived the winter and their hard work would have ended there.Joe and Laurie continued as best they could and six years from the beginning, in 2020, they began to see the finish line in sight - finally! What they could not foresee was the new challenge that lay ahead. After nearly six months of struggling with ill health, dramatic weight loss, and weakness, Laurie has been diagnosed with stage 4A ovarian cancer. Unless God intervenes, she is not expected to go into remission. Family and friends have come together once again to endeavour to finish the straw bale house so that Joe and Laurie can enjoy the fruit of their labour together. The dream to extend hospitality and support to others however, lives on and with completion of the straw bale house, not only will Laurie's dream and their life's work be completed, but together, they can see the ministry of the straw bale house begin, by sharing it with pastors and missionaries in need of God's sustenance. This is why we've come to call the straw bale home, ""The house that Jesus Build.""At this time, Joe and Laurie's daughters Alice, Elizabeth, and Sally, have put together this GoFundMe Fundraiser to raise the funds needed to finish the straw bale home so Joe and Laurie can see the Hay House completed, spend time together in it, and to finally open it to others in need to complete their original ministry vision. With Laurie unable to do much work on the house due to her illness, and Joe unable to work his usual jobs while caring for Laurie, these funds are needed to hire workers to complete the house above and beyond what we as a family can do by-hand. Including labourers and supplies, it's estimated the home can be completed with $50,000 and we intend to hire the newly Christian men of Shalom House, a residential rehabilitation centre located in the heart of the Swan Valley in Perth Western Australia, to give back to God in another way during the final stages of building. Any remaining or additional funds raised will be utilized in two ways; to complete the renovations of ""the shack"" so this space can be used as an additional space for pastors and missionaries staying at the straw bale home ministry, and any remainder to be given back to groups and missionary couples in need.?As Joe and Laurie's daughters, we thank you for your generous donation and consideration of this fundraiser as it's so close to our hearts. We have watched our parents give back over the years over and above what they could afford, and help so many people along the way. We've watched them continuously take in those in need and provide a warm home and meals to children and adults alike. Offer support to recovering addicts to get back on their feet. Provide pastoral support and counselling for individuals, couples, and children, and those who have lost parents and those in palliative care. We've watched them uproot their own lives to care for both of Laurie's parents as they journeyed toward the end of their lives. We've seen them inspire and sustain churches all across Western Australia in their ministry, and have been inspired with their strength as they've courageously fought every obstacle thrown in their way. With full and passionate hearts, we thank you for supporting them in the way they have never hesitated to serve and support others. We are so grateful; this means so much to us and our families.?With thanks, may God bless you and keep you in the palm of His hand.?Alice, Elizabeth, and Sally - and families.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1118,Save Our Seminarians Fund,"Created June 24, 2020","Missions, Faith & Church","$21,800 ","$250,00",254,656,255,"From six years of age, my dream was to become a Catholic priest. I dedicated over twenty years of my life to serving the Church, and those who have known me supported this call. I began my studies for priesthood in the Archdiocese of New York, and Cardinal Dolan nominated me to continue my studies at the Pontifical North American College (NAC) in Rome. There I met with continued achievement as a top-student with accolades from the Cardinal, faculty, and peers.While at the NAC, I witnessed inappropriate physical behavior committed by the vice-rector, Father Adam Park, toward a seminarian. The seminarian later divulged to me that Father Park made other physical contact described as ?úhurtful.??My concern for my classmates??safety was only heightened as I received additional reports alleging inappropriate behaviors by the vice-rector, urging for an investigation into these behaviors, and even citing an instance of a seminarian ?úcrying out for help.?ùIn October of 2018, I was told by physicians that I needed to return to New York for urgent surgery. I obtained permissions for a brief six-week leave which Cardinal Dolan approved in writing, and I continued all of my studies during my recovery. Five days before I was to return to the NAC, the Cardinal informed me that the NAC rector, Father Peter Harman, was blocking my return on the basis of fabricated claims against my ?úpermission documentation??and formation easily disprovable by evidence. I requested on five occasions a meeting with the Cardinal which he denied me. It became apparent that he wanted neither to allow me to present my documentation refuting the false statements against me, nor to receive evidence of Father Park?ôs alleged misconduct. In good faith, I could not be complicit with what I believed was a cover-up of what I knew of the vice-rector, and I could do no other than resign under duress as a seminarian. Were it not for Cardinal Dolan?ôs handwritten food-stained letter sealing his refusal to grant me an impartial interview, I would have been ordained a deacon this year and soon after a priest.Unfortunately, I am only one of hundreds of seminarians documented to have been retaliated against over the past twenty years for exposing clerical misconduct taking place in seminaries. This situation has led to a dramatic decrease in priestly ordinations which in just one year recently declined by 27 percent.Amid pleas for help by NAC seminarians, many supporters and I reported my case to every level of the Church hierarchy for over a year-and-a-half imploring that I be given a chance to present my evidence, clear my name, and have an investigation opened into Father Park?ôs alleged misconduct. While Fathers Harman and Park to this day remain in their roles exerting control over vulnerable NAC seminarians, my reports have gone unaddressed, depriving me of justice from a Church I so faithfully served. The apparent cover-up taking place validates what many have told me: culpable Church leaders will listen to my case only when faced with a lawsuit. Having exhausted all options to resolve my case in the Church, I now prepare to take legal action. Professionals are confident I have a strong case given the copious evidence I possess. As my lawyer prepares to file suit, I realize that those to be held accountable have massive financial resources only bolstered by their many appeals for donations. For this reason, I ask your support that will allow my legal case to move forward and uphold my efforts to raise awareness so that no seminarian should have to suffer as I have. My case is not the first involving the victimization of seminarians, but with your help, I hope that it may be the last.I also invite you to learn more and stay updated about this case by following and sharing the blog ?úSave our Seminarians"": saveourseminarians.wordpress.com?May good men and women take this chance to stand up for what is right, so that silence may no longer yield new generations of victims.

By liberating children from situations of homelessness, poverty, abuse, or abandonment, we aim to instill in them an enduring hope that fuels long-term, positive impact within their communities. The organization has built communities in Kenya, Honduras and Guatemala.?Horizon also focuses on the four aspects of holistic care, to ensure these children have the best opportunity possible to succeed.?Four Aspects of Holistic Care (from Horizon website listed below):Physical Well-Being- Caring for a child?ôs physical well-being begins with a foundation of high quality health and dental care and a rich, nourishing diet. Additionally, our security staff and house parents ensure that the children feel safe and protected at all times.Education for Life- From character building to responsibility, our children are taught to be curious and open to what the world has to offer. They are given a variety of educational opportunities, from rigorous academics to practical, hands-on life skills.Nurturing Hearts, Minds & Spirits- To ensure healthy social and emotional development of orphaned children, it is critical for them to be able to confront and move beyond the trauma they have endured. With time, guidance and support of our social workers on the ground, our children recover hope for their futures and develop productive relationships with others.Loving Family Environment- Probably the most important aspect of providing orphaned children with holistic care is creating an authentic family environment. It is here where children can experience the genuine love of caring adults, a sense of protection and safety, encouragement and respect, and a place where their voice can be heard.https://empowertheorphaned.org/?For more information on this great cause the LA Podcast is raising money for, watch their interview with Horizon?ôs Co-Founder, Jim Pesce.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLnn021dGvs&t=750s?Thanks to anyone who is able to donate, every little bit helps!

I didn't come here specifically to provide a Air Ambulance service, but upon arriving here we quickly saw the daily, needless loss of life on many of the remote islands around us all because of a lack of transportation. The boats that are available can cost the patient's family up to 50,000p ($1000) to hire, but they are slow and when the waves get big they have to let the patient suffer and die in the clinic since the boats can't go.?? ? Now PAMAS has one helicopter and two airplanes on the island of Palawan making hundreds of medevac flights each year. Our services are free to the indigent and all others just pay for our fuel if they can. I absolutely love this work! The people here deserve this service and we are happy to provide it for them!? ? At the heart of our small fleet of aircraft is a Cessna U206F. Despite having only one engine it is the perfect air ambulance for us. In May of 2017 we overhauled the engine and since then it has flown almost 300 medevac flights! The shortest of these flights is 2 hrs, but many of these flights are from 4-7 hrs.?? ?This brings me to the heart of my appeal for help. This engine is about to time out and EVERY TIME this has happened our aircraft go out of service for at least SIX months! We have to wait for parts to be shipped to and from the States and as a pilot I dread this because we have no other aircraft that can continue serving the people and this means going back to the uncalled for loss of life.?? Are you willing to partner together with us in order to keep these life saving, air ambulance services accessible to the people of this region of the Philippines? Would you please join us as volunteer pilots and medical staff here who are constantly risking our lives to show these people that in God's eyes they are highly valued? If so please help us reach our goal of at least $38,000. ? ?This money will used to purchase a complete engine, ship it to the Philippines and probably be enough to overhaul our existing propeller.

Amen!??úNow this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.??2 Corinthians 9:6?The Baltimore city Debre Berhan Kidist Selassie (Holy Trinity) Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church was established in 2002. Our church is part of the DMV EOTC Archdiocese and Ethiopian Synod. Since its inception, the church has provided spiritual guidance, worship, social and communal support and, cultural celebration and reaffirmation. The church also teaches children and the youth, the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Ethiopian language, and the different customs/teachings of our Orthodox Tewahdo Church. Most importantly, the church is the backbone for the formation of brotherhood and sisterhood between its members in the Baltimore area.??Our congregation has been growing steadily over the past few years. Currently, we share a church-building owned by Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore. Due to restrictions put on by the owners (who also actively use it), we are unable to fully use the church to carry out the liturgical services. We use the church for about 4-6 hours per week. One of the major shortcomings from this arrangement is that we are not able to properly educate our children and youth to become spiritually and morally mature human beings. In addition, this arrangement has made it difficult to reach out to the Baltimore city community to show/teach the rich history of the Ethiopian Orthodox church that has existed since the beginning of Christianity. ?The church is primarily run by volunteers. We have exhaustively used volunteers to raise money by working in places such as stadiums during football games. However, the money we?ôve raised over the past few years is not enough to purchase a church building in Baltimore area. ?Most churches that are currently out on sale in Baltimore area cost, on average, around 600-900K. We have already established a 7-person team who would oversee the purchasing of the building.

Here I create resources to help churches tell the story of our Lord and Savior and now I want to give you a chance to participate in the development of a new resource. A social media platform for pastors and churches: Pastor.comThe secular media is now routinely shutting down speech and the big tech firms who own all the viable social media platforms do the same, or at least they throttle the ability of you the pastor to reach your congregation. It is our desire to give churches and their leaders the ability to speak to all their members instantly and to have those messages delivered to all the intended targets. If a pastor has 5000 members and needs to reach all those members with an update or message then every one of them should get that communication. Currently a fraction of the intended recipients would ever see a post on big platforms like Twitter and Facebook.?We will start building Pastor.com in December of this year - 2020. I want to give a select group of pastors and/or church leaders the chance to participate in this project. Any amount is appreciated: $10, $20, or $30.

A two year membership to Sermons.com, a $180 value, provided you are not currently a member and have never been a member.? ? ?2. Login access to Pastor.com as we build it so you can see how projects like this progress.? ? ?3. The ability to suggest directions for development. We will always respond to these.? ? ?4. First choice on ""your_name @ pastor.com"" (spaces added) forwarding email address. Currently none exist so first names are available.? ? ?5. Five years of free access to all levels of Pastor.com.

This closure and the rapid, massive loss of income has significantly reduced the possibility of continuing our church services once the lockdown is lifted. Our membership is primarily comprised of recent immigrants and first-generation Americans who have left their native countries fleeing political, ethnic or religious persecution. We continue to see the increase of migration both from abroad, as well as from other states in the US, to Florida?ôs First Coast area. The Jacksonville area has become home to a growing Ethiopian & Eritrean population and the need for these orthodox churches is increasing quickly. Our churches serve the spiritual needs of our growing community. In addition, it plays a critical role in transitioning new immigrants to the United States and the local community by offering job training, housing/resettlement, education, and a strong support network for on-going needs. Since many of Parish members have limited financial means to make extra donations to overcome the above referenced loss of income, we have been making many efforts to fundraise. However, even with these funds, we are nowhere near the amount of money needed for basic, operational costs. Therefore, we are desperately seeking further assistance from everyone. ?With your help, we are hoping to achieve our goal and continue to serve our community. We are truly grateful for the opportunity to request assistance from you. Thank you and may God continue to bless you for the great work you do to further His Kingdom.Please help us continue to serve His Kingdom through your generosity.Sincerely,Coordinating CommitteeEthiopian & Eritrean Orthodox Churches??Unity, Jacksonville, FL""?®·??Ä?†·? ?≠·????®·??∞·å• ?•·? ?ê·?

1136,Pastor Dale Meador's Journey with ALS,"Created August 25, 2020","Missions, Faith & Church","$18,980 ","$15,000 ",109,447,103,"Pastor Dale Meador has helped the lives of countless people in countless ways. As Nancy and Dale begin the journey of navigating his ALS, his friends are reaching out and creating this campaign to help Dale, Nancy and the rest of his family not worry about day to day life, and focus on the time they have together. So this is our opportunity to express our love and support to Dale and Nancy for their decades of? dedication and ministry to serving others. One of the first projects we can help them with is a renovation of their front and back yards to remove the unruly lawns and make the landscape as free of maintenance as possible so theirs will be a comfortable home for Nancy going forward. She will have her hands full with the Airbnb, a good source of security for her future. As we identify other needs we will keep you all updated.? Let us help them be unburdened by trivial things in life, to focus on family before the next chapter comes. Below are the words of Pastor Dale to better explain where his health is at and his discovery of ALS. Thanks so much for your support - Bruce Moon----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I don?ôt remember when it started. I just remember, for the first time ever, having to think about my breathing while I was preaching. It was a strain: I had to consciously pull in air in order to have enough to keep speaking, especially when emphasizing a point.?I don?ôt remember when it started, but I know when?I can hear it. When I went back and listened to recordings of my preaching, I could hear the difference between the messages of February 2 and February 9.? On February 2, I sounded normal, and reasonably strong. On February 9, strained and wheezy.This began a period of attention to my voice. I thought perhaps that three recent surgeries (prostate cancer, kidney cancer, and a hernia) and the tube they run down your throat for them might have damaged me somehow. But a scope of my throat by an ENT came up negative.? I began speech therapy and eventually wound up at the pulmonologist?ôs office. He?ôs the lung guy, and the tests they gave me showed pretty quickly that it wasn?ôt a lung issue: it?ôs the muscles that help to operate the lungs. The tests pointed to a muscular degenerative disease.Our daughter-in-love Rebecca had also visited a pulmonologist recently. With most of the remains of her brain tumor removed shortly after she gave birth to our Princess Peanut - my pet name for Caroline - Rebecca is always vigilant for symptoms that might show that the tumor is growing or moving. She had some of the same tests I was eventually given. Thankfully, she checked out okay. But because of Rebecca?ôs tests Nancy was looking at that information when she came across the information for ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig?ôs Disease. As Nancy read, she realized that I checked all the boxes for that, and had for some time without realizing it.So our visit with the pulmonologist and a subsequent visit to a neurologist have all but confirmed a diagnosis of ALS for me. I have to have another test before it can be said to be certain, but the neuro Doc said it?ôs basically a done deal.This comes as a surprise, and a little scary. If you look at a reputable website, the fifth and sixth sentences say something like, ?úThere is no cure for this disease??and ?úALS will eventually rob you of moving, breathing, swallowing and talking.?ù¬?Man.? I don?ôt know about you, but moving, breathing, swallowing and talking have been four of my favorite hobbies.So we are sitting here, digesting this news. I awaken in the middle of the night, thinking of a million little things that need to be done or arranged. Little things like: ?úWill Nancy know how to remove the battery cover on the smoke alarm without breaking off that little tab???and big things like, ?úHow can she stay in this house???We?ôve just begun to think about all this, but most of my initial concern relates to setting up Nancy. Immediately, our kids have stepped up and told me not to worry about all this, but you all know how much better it will be if she can live independent of much of their time and concern.Anyway, all that is premature and I know that the Lord will provide. When I shared the news with our Elders they immediately assured me that I don?ôt need to worry about such future things. And I know that?ôs true: our Church Family has always been so very very very kind to us, through the ups and downs of life together for over 20 years. Still, many questions weigh on us just now; Nancy, me, and our kids are all processing this.Some of you know what this is like: you too are wrestling with such end-of-life questions, or have. You or a loved one have received a similar diagnosis, or one from the same family of bad diagnoses.? God love you: I just got another heapin??helping of empathy for what you are going through, or what you went through.Mainly what I wanted to share was this: Isn?ôt it wonderful that on the first Sunday I should preach with the expectation that I had ALS that I would preach that section of John 8 that included these precious words from our Lord Jesus:??úTruly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.?ùAfter the message, several people reached out to me to say that it was helpful to be challenged to be ready to trust Jesus not only in life, but in death.? One couple shared that it would have been so helpful, at the death of her sister, if they could have spoken in plain terms about death and resurrection and gospel hope but instead the atmosphere was mute since some of their loved ones couldn't?bear to deal with death squarely. Another person, a widow, told me in tears that the loss of her husband has been hard, but would have been 10x harder if she didn?ôt have the hope of life after death, and the hope that indeed true disciples will never ?úsee??or ?útaste??death. Personally, in God?ôs providence that text could not have been better timed.On top of that, Beaux?ôs comprehensive message this morning was the perfect follow-up for anyone looking for real comfort in the face of suffering, which only find meaning and purpose in the Lord!Nancy and I delivered a rental truck full of Family Retreat supplies to Twin Rocks for the upcoming Joni and Friends Family Retreats there. Normally, we would stay and serve for the two weeks, but this year it seemed best to drop out weeks back. That was a hard decision: most of you know how important that ministry has been to us over the years, and how much we love the families affected by disability served through it. Now that decision has proved to be best: it?ôs best that we don?ôt serve this year. Instead, we dropped the truck and then drove from the camp without speaking to anyone (to keep the camp COVID-safe) and went across the street to the beach.? There, we wept, knowing it is unlikely I will serve there again.?My head is swimming; Nancy is overwhelmed. But last night I made a statement akin to: ?úThis is an opportunity to prove what I?ôve been preaching??or words to that effect. That could sound like, ?úNow I?ôve got to do my part in dying well, Jesus having done his part for me already.??That?ôs not what I mean, or not what i should mean. Frankly, I don?ôt know if I can die well: when I read about the progression of ALS, it scares me. So honestly I know I can?ôt do it.? And so instead I should say this: ?úI?ôve trusted in the Lord all these years, and now I?ôm going to have to trust him in a new important way, that his strength be shown in my encroaching weakness.???It?ôs important that he be glorified, and not that I am said to be courageous or strong.? That should be easy: right now I feel anything but that!? Again, I love you and your families and thank you for your role in our family and church family.?ùThank you for your love and concern for Nancy and me and our family. While I don?ôt see any interruption of my role in the ministry to which I was called, I would ask you to please pray that the Lord would give us and BCC?ôs Elders wisdom for the decisions that lay ahead, and confidence in him in the face of all uncertainty.- Pastor Dale",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are asking for help to purchase this location. We write multiple grants to cover the cost of offering free services. We receive donations from churches, businesses, and individuals that help cover operational cost. We also operate a landscaping and cleaning service to help offset additional cost. We are the only existing recovery home in our county and have been working towards expanding our capacity until this matter arose.Regardless of amount we appreciate everyone?ôs generosity and prayer during this time. We know God can easily provide for this need but if His will is in another direction, we will embrace that and continue to seek His face and serve His children. Thank you for taking the time to read about our situation and please remember us throughout the remainder of this month.?This link is to a story by WBIR reporting on one of our many strategic partnerships. https://www.wbir.com/mobile/article/news/health/campbell-co-health-clinic-helps-hepatitis-c-patients-with-new-treatment/51-1193e2d4-1bc8-4681-bfaf-bd4d47035660?jwsource=em?Below link is from Knoxville News Sentential ?https://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/2019/08/20/white-house-committed-ending-rural-americas-addiction-crisis/1967897001/The program is nine months in duration; however, we encourage residents?to stay at least two years to develop deep and longstanding community.?We are driven by our love and faith in Christ to serve this population of men. Not all, but a large portion of our residents come from extremely dysfunctional homes and have experienced severe trauma in their childhoods. We believe in Christ there is freedom from addiction and those underlying issues which most often lead individuals to substance abuse and broken behavioral pattens.?At Springs of Life, we provide free services to help demonstrate our love for each resident. We believe meeting the residents??needs in their current situation is vital to breaking down walls and developing healthy longstanding relationships, We call this ?úmeeting them where they are.??We believe Jesus demonstrated His love for us while yet we were sinners, and we should walk in His example. This method can also contribute to the deconstruction of mindsets who may fear ulterior motives from those who wish to help.?The goal is for each resident to work towards autonomy, and when residents enter month seven of the program, they obtain employment through our strategic partnerships and begin paying residential fees. During their stay at Springs of Life, all residents receive free food, clothing, housing, counseling, access to free Hepatitis C treatments, dental services, prescriptions, access to free health care, theological small groups, transportation, G.E.D classes,?and target case management.?Our focus is to help each resident develop coping skills, basic life skills, soft skills, vocational skills, and most importantly a deep and passionate relationship with God and others. Residents participate in serving the less fortunate and learn the value of hard work and commitment.?Donations will only go towards the purchase of the building.

My beloved invited me to be His Bride and specifically to be His Carmelite Bride. I am beyond excited to accept this call and to continue on this adventure with Him. With this invitation comes RADICAL trust, which is both humbling and crazy. I have complete faith that He will continue to show me His Divine Providence and help me to answer this call so that more souls will come to know Him. I am confident that through YOUR help, generosity and prayers that I will be able to live in freedom by being debt free from my student loans. This freedom will allow me to be fully present as a Candidate with the Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles. https://carmelitesistersocd.com/?November 2013, I gave my life to Christ in the Chapel at The College of William and Mary. I knew that I was meant for something more. I had no idea what it was, but I knew that God was calling me higher. He was calling me more than solely the mediocre life that I was living for Him in college.? After a challenging breakup, I quickly realized that I did not have many friends, but had a great desire to keep growing in my faith. Through this realization and sudden abundance of time, I started praying daily in the Catholic Campus Ministry (CCM) Chapel. These short minutes of prayer aching for the Lord to ease my pain turned into 10 minutes, which turned into 30 minutes, which eventually led to daily Holy Hours as a missionary with FOCUS (Fellowship of Catholic University Students).? God took my incredibly tiny minuscule 'yes' and ran with it. He softened my heart for 7 years and romanced me like no one ever has. He constantly met me where I was. He made invitations to serve Him in Alabama, Florida, Texas and back home in Virginia.? He provided for me then, and I know that He is providing for me now.? I accumulated $29,000 in student loans graduating from The College of William and Mary, and I need to be debt-free in order to move on from Candidacy to Postulancy if that is God's call for me. Any additional funds raised, will go towards my dowry, which will ensure that I will have health insurance during my formation in Postulancy and the Novitiate. I have absolutely loved my time in Candidacy with the Carmelites, but would love to live in complete freedom for the remainder of the year. Please prayerfully consider to support me in this journey through your spiritual and financial support.? God can never be outdone in generosity. Thank you in advance and know of my prayers!

Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.??2 Corinthians 9:6?The Baltimore city Debre Berhan Kidist Selassie (Holy Trinity) Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church was established in 2002. Our church is part of the DMV EOTC Archdiocese and Ethiopian Synod. Since its inception, the church has provided spiritual guidance, worship, social and communal support and, cultural celebration and reaffirmation. The church also teaches children and the youth, the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Ethiopian language, and the different customs/teachings of our Orthodox Tewahdo Church. Most importantly, the church is the backbone for the formation of brotherhood and sisterhood between its members in the Baltimore area.??Our congregation has been growing steadily over the past few years. Currently, we share a church-building owned by Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore. Due to restrictions put on by the owners (who also actively use it), we are unable to fully use the church to carry out the liturgical services. We use the church for about 4-6 hours per week. One of the major shortcomings from this arrangement is that we are not able to properly educate our children and youth to become spiritually and morally mature human beings. In addition, this arrangement has made it difficult to reach out to the Baltimore city community to show/teach the rich history of the Ethiopian Orthodox church that has existed since the beginning of Christianity. ?The church is primarily run by volunteers. We have exhaustively used volunteers to raise money by working in places such as stadiums during football games. However, the money we?ôve raised over the past few years is not enough to purchase a church building in Baltimore area. ?Most churches that are currently out on sale in Baltimore area cost, on average, around 600-900K. We have already established a 7-person team who would oversee the purchasing of the building. We hope to raise at least $150K which would be sufficient to cover part of the down payment to purchase the church building. Anything you can give us, no matter how small it is, would make a big difference for us.?As of August 2020, we have already found a magnificent church building and are in the middle of price negotiations.

We have not even begun to comprehend the size of the loss of tools such as table saws, leaf rakes, snow shovels, sanders, air compressors and nail guns, spare lightbulbs, new toilets, floor paint, and everything else needed for a well-maintained camp (including numerous personally-owned tools). We keep a large store of all sorts of tools for when big groups of volunteers come to help.We appreciate your prayers for us as we assess the damage, begin the cleanup, and make plans for a new maintenance building. We did have some content insurance, and a few of the vehicles had individual insurance policies, but this is a significant loss nonetheless. However, God is unchanged and we rest in Him as we labor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

En fait, le type 1 est le type le plus dangereux de cette maladie.L'amyotrophie spinale (AMS) est une maladie neuromusculaire qui se manifeste par une perte progressive de la force musculaire qui affecte la capacit√© ? marcher, ? avaler et ? respirer. Et c'est la premi√®re cause g√©n√©tique de mortalit√© infantile. Elle est caus√©e par une mutation du g√®ne de survie des motoneurones 1 (SMN1). Ce g√®ne est responsable de la production d'une prot√©ine qui est essentielle aux nerfs qui contr√¥lent nos muscles. Sans cette prot√©ine, ces neurones ne peuvent pas fonctionner correctement et meurent ? un moment donn√©.Afin d'avoir un meilleur avenir, R√ºmeysa doit recevoir une th√©rapie g√©n√©tique appel√©e Zolgensma. Le Zolgensma est con√ßu pour remplacer le g√®ne SMN1 manquant ou d√©fectueux par une copie fonctionnelle qui produit la prot√©ine SMN, am√©liorant ainsi la fonction et la survie des motoneurones. Il semble que le Zolgensma puisse sauver la vie de ceux qui ont la chance de l'obtenir gr√¢ce ? un traitement ? dose unique.Zolgensma co√ªte 2,4 millions de dollars (avec les frais d'hospitalisation). L'autorisation de Zolgensma ne couvre que les enfants de moins de 2 ans. Ce n'est qu'avec ce traitement que R√ºmeysa peut marcher. Elle a maintenant 13 mois et elle court contre le temps.Aidez R√ºmeysa ? mener une vie normale, comme n'importe quel autre enfant ! Toute contribution, petite ou grande, fait une diff√©rence. Et s'il vous pla√Æt, partagez cet appel !Vous trouverez ci-dessous l'histoire de R√ºmeysa et le message de sa famille. Vos dons seront tr√®s appr√©ci√©s. Cette campagne est exclusivement d√©di√©e ?

Cependant, au fil du temps, nous avons r√©alis√© qu'elle n'avait aucun mouvement avec son corps et on lui a diagnostiqu√© une SMA de type 1 ? l'√¢ge de 3 mois.

Aidez-nous ? lui sauver la vie"".ENG___________________________________________________I have organized this charity campaign for my nephew?ôs daughter R√ºmeysa who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1 disease.?Actually, the type 1 one is the most dangerous type of this disease. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease, which is manifested by a progressive loss of muscle strength that affects the ability to walk, swallow and breathe. And it is the first genetic cause of infant mortality. It is caused by a mutation in the survival gene of motor neurons 1 (SMN1). This gene is responsible for the production of a protein that is critical for the nerves that control our muscles. Without this protein, these neurons cannot function properly and die at any given time. In order to have a?better future, R√ºmeysa has to receive a genetic therapy called Zolgensma. Zolgensma is designed to replace the missing or defective SMN1 gene with a functional copy that produces the SMN protein, thereby improving the function and survival of motor neurons. It seems that Zolgensma can save lives of those who are lucky enough to get it with a single dose treatment.Zolgensma costs $ 2.4 million (together with hospital expenses). Zolgensma approval only covers children under 2 years. Only with this treatment, R√ºmeysa can walk. She is now 13 months and she is racing against time.Please help R√ºmeysa to live a normal life, like any other child! Any contribution, large or small, makes a difference. And please share this appeal!Below, you can find the story of R√ºmeysa and her family's message. Your donations will be greatly appreciated. This campaign is dedicated exclusively to R√ºmeysa.Family?ôs message: ?úWhen R√ºmeysa was born, she was normal like any other baby. However, as we go along with the time, we realized that she had not any movements with his body and she has been diagnosed SMA Type 1 when she was 3 months old. When we learned that our daughter diagnosed with the most dangerous and mortal type of the SMA, we were devastated all family. Children diagnosed with the type 1 are supposed to live only 2 years. We had no idea what was happening and everything seemed to run in the wrong direction. We feel to be not able to do anything. Seeing our daughter leaving us day-by-day makes me suffered deeply. Moreover, knowing that there is a remedy very expensive that could save our daughter is more devastating than ever. Zolgensma could really save our daughter?ôs life. We want her to live. Please help us to save her live.??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When he did not return in the time frame expected, his family became concerned. A couple family members went looking for him and called police due to the time and his errand location corresponding with the mass shooting that was happening in Nova Scotia. Joey was missing for several hours before the family learned that he was indeed one of the victims who was killed.Joey left behind his partner, Shanda MacLeod and their two beautiful daughters. He is also survived by his teen daughter, his father, sister, brother-in-law, niece and nephew. Joey was currently out of work due to the recent shut down of the pulp mill affecting many who work in the forestry industry. Edited to add: He had just started back to work on Friday, April 17. ?Joey was the sole provider for their family, which leaves Shanda and her girls in a financially hard place on top of the tragedy that has occurred.We, Shanda?ôs family, are asking for donations for burial or cremation costs initially. All money raised above that will go directly to Shanda and the girls for current and future living expenses so Shanda does not have to rush out to look for work (she really can?ôt during this pandemic), but can continue to stay-at-home with the girls while they grieve their loss. Beyond that, we are hopeful that they gather a little nest egg for the girls??future education as well.Thank you all for reading, sharing and helping our sister and daughter out.

In addition to losing a loving husband and devoted father, Megan and the kids have also lost significant financial resources. Unfortunately, although Pete had limited life insurance, it is woefully insufficient to provide Elsie, Cora, and Christopher the rich childhood, overflowing with sports, arts, music, and adventure, that Megan and Pete always intended.To that end, we are seeking donations to help Megan defray existing and increased childcare costs that she will now have to bear without Pete. ?Everyone who crossed paths with Pete, whether in Cheshire, at Yale or Michigan, or in San Diego, knows that he was an absolutely remarkable man.?

The only treatment available, palliative radiotherapy, will finish in two weeks. We must take our next step urgently. We reached out to the DIPG specialists globally and found some promising options in the USA and Switzerland. However, patients who are not residents of these countries are required to provide all funding themselves; as you can imagine this very expensive and therefore cost prohibitive. For example, the trial we are currently exploring in New York starts from $300,000? for the trial alone excluding costs for travel and accommodation. A CAR-T trial in California costs more than double that. We have also contacted the DIPG Centre of Expertise in Zurich, and they are planning to open a couple of trials in the coming months. We are anxiously awaiting more details, and we have been advised the cost in Zurich is also substantial in similar range to ones in US.For Lily to be eligible for these trials? at current stage, she needs to be enrolled within 12-14 weeks of completing her course of Radiotherapy. This means that Lily must begin her trials in December at the very latest to give us the best chance of buying her the precious time she deserves. Like many families, we are facing huge logistical challenges as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic but we are determined to do everything it takes to give Lily the best care possible and we are receiving support to overcome these hurdles with the aim of Lily joining the trial in November.Lily, a truly global citizen, needs your help to travel a bit further.We do not want DIPG to be all that Lily?ôs life is about. She is our little fighter, but more importantly she is just a 7-year-old child. She wants her ?únormal life??back more than anything- she wants to dance and sing and help the younger students with their maths. She wants to play in the park with her younger sister, Mia. As Lily goes through the treatments and the challenges associated with them, we want to make her days as bright as they can be. We have planned her return to school in September and we would love to make the trip to Disneyland or Legoland while her condition still allows. Can you help to light up our path ahead?? Any donation, large or small, will be gratefully received and be used towards Lily?ôs medical needs and obtaining the best possible care in order to help extend her life and make memories along this journey.Fighting DIPG is a dark journey for patients, families, friends as well as scientists and healthcare professionals who are struggling to find a long-term cure with little or no funding. Any money not used by us will be donated to a suitable DIPG charity to raise the much-needed awareness,? which could light up a future where children and their families do not have to go through this horrible nightmare. We need your help- keep the light of hope burning for Lily and her family.Thank you,Vineet and JingFacts about DIPG:https://dipg.org/dipg-facts/what-is-dipg/DIPG most commonly strikes kids between 4-11 years of age It affects approx. 30 children annually in the UK and 300 in the USThe median survival rate from diagnosis is 9 monthsDIPG leaves kids mentally intact but steals essential bodily functions over time such as vision, swallowing, walking and breathing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their loss is immeasurable.Thank you to everyone who has reached out to express their condolences. Any expression of sympathy is greatly appreciated.?This crowdfunding has been set up by the family of Lesley and Rhyan. Funds collected will be deposited into? a trust account for the benefit of Lesley's surviving children. ? Lesley's and Rhyan's obituaries are below, along with the funeral home links to stories of remembrance.?LESLEY DENISE PRATHER (DRURY), age 40, was born January 26, 1980 in Louisville, KY. She went to meet her heavenly Father on February 14, 2020 hand in hand with her beloved daughter, Rhyan Prather.Lesley was blessed to be the center of a massive family that she loved dearly. She graduated from Pleasure Ridge Park High School where she lettered in three sports including volleyball, basketball and track & field. She went on to play volleyball at the University of Louisville where she led her team to three conference championships, four NCAA appearances and a Sweet Sixteen appearance. She was named All-Conference USA twice and was named to the AVCA All-Region team. She coached the IUS volleyball team from 2009-2012. She was currently a coach for the KIVA 10 volleyball team.As if she hadn?ôt accomplished enough in her academic, sports, personal life, Lesley set her mind on becoming a firefighter (and when she set her mind on anything, she accomplished it). Lesley spent the last four years protecting and serving her community as a member of the Louisville Fire Department. Lesley was proud to serve her community, proud of her ?úfirst responders??family and most proud to encourage girls and woman that you can be whatever you want to be in life. Lesley was a proud member of the LFD and engine 22.How do you put in to words a life that was lived so fully? It was never about herself but rather about others. She was Superwoman in real life. A hero amongst us. Let?ôs just say it, a true ?úbadass?? The epitome of a mother and wife who unconditionally loved everyone that she came in to contact with. Being a mother to her four children was the biggest love of her life and her most proud accomplishment. Family was everything and she was a protective Mama Bear of her family. Lesley was a bright light in a world that can be so dimly lit at times with the most radiant infectious smile that you ever saw. Saying that she was the life of the party would be an understatement. When God created Lesley He broke the mold, with just the right amount of love, loyalty, grace, humor, compassion, fire, fierce competitiveness and humility. Lesley was an amazing leader & a coach on and off the court. When Lesley said to do something, you knew to do it. She was an inspiration to all of us. Our lives and days were better every day she was in them. She will truly be missed.Lesley was preceded in death by her father, Alan Drury; grandparents, Melvin and Carolyn Dunaway and Stoy and Anna Drury.She is survived by her husband, Justin Prather; son, Brennan Prather; daughters, Lacey and Randi Prather; mother, Mary Reichelt (David); sisters, Sarah Petkovic (Sash), Stacey Hall (Terry) and Leslie Isner (Matt); brother, Scott Drury (Ashleigh); as well as many extended family and friends.Funeral services will be held 11 a.m. Friday, February 21, 2020 at Southeast Christian Church; 920 Blankenbaker Pkwy, with private burial to follow in Calvary Cemetery.

She went to meet her heavenly Father on February 14, 2020 alongside her loving mother, Lesley Prather.Rhyan was a seventh grader at Noe Middle School where she was a member of the volleyball team. She was also a member of the Falls City Soccer Club and KIVA. Rhyan was an incredible athlete and loved playing club volleyball and soccer. She was a great teammate, a leader and sister to all of her teammates.It?ôs hard to believe the impact that in just 12 short years Rhyan made, but she sure did make one. Rhyan had a million-dollar radiant infectious smile that was one of a kind. Rhyan was such a beautiful girl who had her Mom?ôs sweet heart and her Dad?ôs unwavering confidence and humor. Rhyan was the heir to the throne of the Superwoman cape that her Mom wore, Rhyan was Super Girl. She loved all her family and friends and was the kind of daughter, sister and friend that we all strive to be. Any time any of her cousins entered a room she greeted them at the door and took them under her wing. To say she had a ?útransparent??(sometimes inappropriate) mouth would be an understatement. Rhyan was hilarious and always could bring a laugh and smile to all of our faces. She was a loyal and devoted friend to all. She was the tik tok and selfie Queen. No one?ôs phone was safe from a selfie if left unattended. Rhyan loved playing with friends, swimming, lake trips and being with her family. Reading this text would make you think that she was a fictional character, but she wasn?ôt, she?ôs real.

Lucas is fighting for his life and needs your help.Lucas is a six-year-old CANCER WARRIOR who lives in Austin, Texas with his parents, big brother Jack (9), and little sister Dylan (4 and a future hero). He is a sports fanatic and a die-hard Boston sports fan (thanks to his mom Erin). He can be found cheering on the Red Sox and Celtics any chance he can as well as his parents??alumni, the Texas Longhorns.On July 31st, 2020, Lucas was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). AML is a RARE cancer, affecting less that 500 children per year in the United States. Lucas immediately underwent a first round of chemotherapy that was unsuccessful in eradicating the cancer cells from his bones. At the end of 28 days of chemo, 60% cancer still remained. Round two called for a more aggressive and intense plan. It involved targeted FLT3 drugs and adult level chemotherapy that have only been used in trials with some children. They are currently evaluating the effect of this treatment and we are keeping our fingers crossed.With AML the white blood cells produced in Lucas's bone marrow are abnormal and do not become healthy cells. These abnormal cells are unable to fight off infection and can be life threatening. Not only is AML exceptionally rare in children, but the mutations of Lucas's cancer are even more rare and unique (FLT3 Non-ITD N676K - less than 20 adolescent cases per year). All pediatric cancers are considered rare and therefore underfunded, under researched, and information about these cases isn't widely shared nor publicized, even within the medical community.Inevitably, Lucas will need a Bone Marrow Transplant. The good news is we have already found a perfect match in his sister Dylan (hence the hero title above), but we need to get Lucas into remission first. We must find a treatment plan that targets Lucas?ôs exact mutation and eradicates the cancer in his bones. To learn more about Lucas?ôs specific cancer type and share any pertinent information that might help connect them with other families, please visit this page: ?https://www.lucasbear.org/beat-aml.The Gourley family decided to relocate to Houston so that Lucas can receive the best care and treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Erin and Brian are solely focused on saving Lucas?ôs life and being present for Jack and Dylan. They are switching roles every 72 hours at the hospital entrance and only allowed to be with each other for about 15 minutes because Lucas is at constant risk of spiking a fever or other things escalating due to the nature of AML. Their ability to earn income has been severely impacted and the expenses are mounting. Insurance is only covering partial costs of some of Lucas's treatment, as well as the clinical trials and drugs that are in their future. They are doing all of this amidst a pandemic and have limited help due to quarantining restrictions and fear of infection.Lucas is a brave warrior but has a long road ahead of him. This fight will be exhausting on all fronts, but we will do whatever it takes to save Lucas and get him the care he needs. It can take years to recover from the financial devastation that childhood cancer treatment can have on a family. We have started this GoFundMe page as a way to ease some of the financial burden the Gourley family is facing and take a bit of the worry off their plates.?We understand that this year has been hard on many people, so if you cannot support financially, please continue to pray for Lucas and his family. Erin and Brian are eternally grateful for all the love and support they have already received, even from people they don?ôt know.?Thank you in advance and please reach out to one of us if you have any questions or other ways to help.?With much gratitude and hope,?Betsy Flanagan & Kathy Sutherland(friends and prayer warriors)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sarah died on September 7th Labor Day in Lawrenceville, GA. Sarah?ôs youngest daughter (9 years old) was wading in the lake with others, unfortunately there was a drop off point nearby. She went underwater and Sarah attempted to reach her. Sarah ingested too much water and went under herself. Others who were nearby were able to pull Sarah?ôs 9 year old to safety and were able to successfully perform CPR on her. During this life saving effort, Sarah was still underwater for about 5 minutes. Good Samaritans were able to pull Sarah from the water and preform CPR on her for 10 minutes before the ambulance arrived. Sarah was not responsive to the life saving efforts from the Good Samaritans. Sarah was transported to the hospital and her four daughters followed in Sarah?ôs vehicle. Sarah?ôs oldest daughter is not an experienced driver and was very brave to drive her sisters under such stressful conditions. Upon arrival to the hospital, the doctors worked on Sarah vigorously as she ?úcode blued??several times. Sarah?ôs girls arrived shortly thereafter and were able to enter the room to witness their mother being worked on by the doctors. A close friend of Sarah?ôs arrived and was able to provide comfort to the girls. After seeing too much to ever forget, the younger children were sent into the hallway. Sarah?ôs oldest child remained in the room sobbing as she gave me a description of the events that were unfolding before her eyes. The doctors told her that there was nothing more they could do. The oldest child did not want to give up on her mother, because her mother never gave up on her when she was a premature baby fighting for her life and needing multiple surgeries thereafter, along with needing a breathing tube for many years. She didn?ôt want to give up on her mother, despite the doctors telling her that Sarah was gone. The younger girls in the hallway were informed of their mother?ôs death and drove home alone with Sarah?ôs friend following behind. Sarah?ôs friend could not stay with the girls overnight, due to having her own family to get back to. Why wasn?ôt anyone else called? The girls were in shock, so thinking clearly was not possible. I was in the process of preparing to depart Washington State for Atlanta. I arrived Tuesday afternoon. The back story on why this tragedy occurred must be told. On Sunday morning September 6th, Sarah took her oldest daughter to work. Sarah?ôs 11 year old wanted to tag along and fell asleep in the back seat. ?After Sarah dropped off the oldest child, Sarah was robbed by three masked gunman in Atlanta. They took her purse, all of the purse?ôs contents and her cell phone. The robbers never noticed the sleeping child in the back seat. Sarah was unharmed and unnerved (she was a tough woman). Sarah had planned to go to Savannah, Georgia ?for Labor Day. Due to the theft, Sarah had no identification, cash or credit cards to travel with, so the trip was canceled. In an attempt to cheer up her girls and get out of the house, she elected to go to the lake. Going to the Lake was not out of the ordinary for Sarah and the girls, however, it was a last minute idea to liven the girl?ôs spirits. Unfortunately for Sarah, she lost her life being exactly what she was ?(and always had been), a good mother! Sarah is a hero on so many levels. ?Sarah lost her mother at the age of 2, as a result of suicide and never had a loving non abusive gaurdian thereafter. Sarah would ?suffer another tragedy in 2006 when our oldest brother committed suicide (Yes, this is all true!). Sarah suffered many injustices as a child. Sarah tried in vain to show her children a better life. Sarah was a single parent living under the poverty line for many years. Sarah was very independent and did not like to ask for assistance. Sarah?ôs youngest girls have minor health problems related to the respiratory system. Sarah?ôs oldest daughter will always need to be monitored closey concerning her narrow airways that can become restricted for a multitude of reasons at anytime. ?Sarah?ôs girls are ages ?9, 11, 13 and 20. Please help me to provide a fresh start for my nieces, who will be forever scarred by the tragic events that occurred on Labor Day September 7th, 2020.?Sincerely,?James Jackson III",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bridges Academy is a public elementary school for students in preschool-5th grade and is a part of the Oakland Unified School District.Our teachers and staff are urgently trying to raise money to support our Bridges Academy community during the COVID-19 crisis. The city of Oakland went into ""shelter in place"" as of March 16th along with the rest of the Bay Area so we can keep our community safe.?However, many of our students and families are now struggling to survive the ""shelter in place"" as they do not have sufficient food and funds to supply their basic needs like diapers. Even in best of times, all of our families qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, so life is that much harder now as many families have reduced work hours or none at all. Food supply is dwindling during the twice a week food banks in Oakland for students. Many families are unable to go the food distribution locations without transportation. Families are worried about not having enough money to pay for their cell phone bills, which is the main way many of our students are accessing online academic content since they don't have Internet and other devices at home.Funds will be used to provide food and other basic needs for our 480 students and their families in the form of cash donations or Visa gift cards. We want to empower families to make their own decisions about what to purchase with the funds, as each families' needs are different. Also, our families have variously dietary needs and preferences, so providing a more flexible way to access food and other necessities would help them greatly in this stressful time.?We hope to get some of these resources to our families as soon as possible, especially in the case of families who were expecting a paycheck that is not coming. All donations and withdrawals will be tracked and documented by our school leadership team and funds will be distributed to our students' families using an equity formula so we can provide some relief to our most vulnerable families. We will follow all government orders and recommendations for safety as we distribute these donations to the families. Funds will be withdrawn by me (Jessica Jung) via a personal bank account, but all withdrawals will be overseen by the school principal, Anita Iverson-Comelo, and our Community Schools Manager, Rosana Covarrubias.?We know everyone is struggling, but we hope you will contribute to this fund to support and provide for the most vulnerable members of our community.

Everything was like a dream and our whole family was complete. After one year we started to notice that something was wrong with Saga. She started to lose weight and became more and more weak. A couple of weeks later she was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. The battle has been going on since 2016 trying to cure her and have our little baby healthy and happy. But in February this year, 2020, we lost what we have been fighting for so long and our beloved angel passed away only 4 years old. It is an unimaginable pain and a great loss that is unbearable.

In Sweden, it is to late to go through an IVF treatment for my sister because of her age. Her daughter got a genetic brain tumor and we need to be helped by a clinic that can screen the embryo so that the next child does not suffer from the same variety.

We have never asked for help and this feels a little scary but in the middle of all the grief and loss we want to find a light.?I am starting this fundraiser because I want to see my sister have her life back.?

When Lucas is not being cared for by his parents, Marie and Antaine, or by his grandmother or his granduncle, who have been trained to look after him, he requires the attention of a nurse. Lucas is unable to move independently, is non-verbal and is confined to a wheelchair. Lucas frequently has breathing difficulties and often needs to use an oxygen mask.

Adam spent several weeks in Crumlin Children?ôs Hospital with his Mum and Dad, but thankfully he is now doing well.Lucas and Adam also have a very vivacious, and very beautiful three-year-old sister, called Alannah.The varying care needs of each of the children of this family have posed very many challenges for Marie and Antaine over the past number of years. Marie is a full-time carer and Mum to all three, and is heavily dependent on the H.S.E?ôs allocation of nursing hours to help with the care of Lucas and provide some periods of respite for Marie.We would like to show our support for this family by raising funds to help purchase a vehicle that will adequately accommodate the need of all three children, and to cover some of the day to day expenses of caring for Lucas.We thank you for your time and generosity in helping us reach our goal.The Fundraising Committee of ?úHope for Lucas?ùChairpersonSin√©ad Lally?[email redacted] | 0863089564",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Steve and Lowly have many friends , and I would like to ask that these friends donate as little or as much as they can, perhaps money that they would have spent travelling to a funeral, or on flowers or such like, or indeed whatever they are comfortable with. Whatever we can raise will help, and every little bit we raise gives Lowly a little less to worry about.?Any cash we raise can not only solve short term worries and allow them to grieve in peace, if we raise enough we can put some aside for the kids for their education. Do it for Steve, ?do it for Lowly.?Please share this with everybody you know who knew Steve, or who knows Lowly, put in on your wall, on their wall, the power of networking is exponential. If we share with all of their friends, all of Steve's former colleagues and all of the clients Steve has helped over the years, we can raise a significant amount and we can at least help his family in a small way in this tragic time.

If you're unable to donate, A prayer is more than enough but if you still want to help, please join us in our mission to raise awareness by sharing Nathan's story.? Thank you.? Below are all of Nathan's diagnosis and symptoms:?DIAGNOSIS: Cutis Laxa Type 3MUTATION: ALDH18A1SYMPTOMS: He has growth deficiencies, Intellectual disability, loose joints & skin, cataracts, corneal abnormalities, Mal Rotation, seizures, involuntary muscle contractions, Trouble eating, cyclic vomiting and severe acid reflux.RAREDISEASES.ORG: This disorder is also known as autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 3 (ARCL3). Affected individuals develop the characteristic skin symptoms of cutis laxa along with growth deficiencies, moderate to severe intellectual disability, loose joints, cataracts and corneal abnormalities. Additional symptoms may eventually develop including dystonia, a group of movement disorders that vary in their symptoms, causes, progression, and treatments. This group of neurological conditions is generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body in abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). Individuals with this form of cutis laxa usually do not have cardiovascular or pulmonary complications. Many individuals with de Barsy syndrome were found to have a mutation in the ALDH18A1 gene.OUR STORY FROM THE BEGINNING:?Baby Nathan was born full term October 2018, weighing just two pounds, but before he was born, doctors had already began to notice he was small.?They had my wife Pamela visit a specialist during the end of her second trimester. That?ôs when it was confirmed, Nathan was not growing normally. ?úI prepared myself for him being small, I prepared myself for the dwarfism, for whatever came my way,??said Pamela.?He wasn?ôt premature, so Nathan?ôs size confused physicians. He was in the NICU for observation for 2 months, during this time genetic testing and every test failed to offer answers. Nathan needed to gain weight in order to be discharged. In the following weeks he gained three pounds, then topping five pounds, Nathan was finally ready to be discharged, until the seizures started.?Nathan had to be rushed to Valley children?ôs Hospital In Madera, all test failed there as well. At this time my wife and I were really starting to lose hope, we weren?ôt getting any answers as to what was going on with our baby. All we saw were tubes, PICC lines and NG tubes. The best word to describe of all of this was a nightmare. As parents we began to question ourselves, we gave into fear and anxiety, did we do something wrong? Was this all our fault? Will our baby survive? So many questions..?The chief geneticist came to us with sad news, In her long time in genetics this was the first time she had seen something like this, so she told us about a state funded program called Project Baby Bear, they conducted a new form of testing called Whole Genome Sequencing. Thanks to that test we received a diagnosis called Cutis Laxa Type 3 from a denovo mutation called ALDH18A1, Non inherited. The symptoms are growth deficiencies, moderate to severe intellectual disability, loose joints and skin, cataracts, corneal abnormalities, mal rotation, seizures, involuntary muscle contractions that force the body in abnormal, sometimes painful movements and positions, trouble eating, hernias, cyclic vomiting and severe acid reflux.??We are extremely grateful to have a diagnosis but we are now facing a disease that has no cure, or treatments. We were discharged from the hospital March 2019. Since then we have focused on raising awareness, reaching out to as many people as we can, not only raise awareness but to find other people with this disease. So far there are only 3 other people in the world with this diagnosis.?Here we are close to his second birthday and have learned so much about acceptance and perseverance, Regardless of this situation, we remain positive. We believe that everything happens for a reason. Nathan has inspired thousands of people so far, although it might be a difficult situation we have to follow baby Nathan?ôs example of never giving up, He?ôs a warrior, destined for greatness. How you define greatness is completely up to you. There?ôs a word in our family that we always use called Auspicious, it means conducive to success, favorable. We like to remind everyone that we are all auspicious. We like to focus on the journey not the destination, worrying about the future only bring anxiety so we will continue this path together, as long as Nathan doesn?ôt give up, neither will we. Stray strong, we hope that our story can inspire you, you?ôre not alone. We?ôre in this together, remember you ARE Auspicious!!THANK YOU TO THE LABRANT FAMILY FOR ALL OF THEIR LOVE.?YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC8gYfDyYTI&feature=youtu.be?INSTAGRAM:?https://www.instagram.com/auspiciousmando/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Das Familienh√∂rbuch-Projekt ist anerkannt als eine Initiative zur Umsetzung der ""Charta zur Betreuung schwerstkranker und sterbender Menschen in Deutschland"".WIESO ES AUCH MEIN HERZENSPROJEKT ISTFrau Gr√ºmmers Familienh√∂rbuch-Projekt ist nun auch mein Herzensprojekt geworden. Denn auch meine Tochter Karin ist eine dieser vom Schicksal so schwer getroffenen, jungen Mamas. Ihr Krebs schreitet rasant voran und viel zu fr√ºh wird sie ihre drei kleinen Kinder - meine wunderbaren Enkelkinder - zur√ºcklassen m√ºssen. Weil Karin leider nicht mehr reisef√§hig ist, machte Frau Gr√ºmmer es mit ganz viel pers√∂nlichem Einsatz kurzfristig m√∂glich, dass Karin ihre Lebensgeschichte bereits in den n√§chsten Tagen in Hamburg erz√§hlen und aufzeichnen kann. Seit Karin wei?, dass es Menschen gibt, die das f√ºr sie m√∂glich machen, erlebe ich jeden Tag hautnah, was das mit ihr und mit uns, ihren sie liebenden Herzensmenschen, Wunderbares macht. In der Zeit des Abschiednehmens ist es f√ºr alle tr√∂stlich zu wissen, dass da etwas ganz Lebendiges und Pers√∂nliches von Karin bleiben wird. Glaubt mir, dass ist purer Zauberglitzer f√ºr ihre und f√ºr unsere Seelen.? Und f√ºr alle Mamas und Papas, die mit ihren Kindern, den letzten Weg gehen m√ºssen.Karins Audiobiografie ist durch die Spenden des Pilotprojektes bereits abgedeckt. Jedoch entstehen f√ºr ein H√∂rbuch einige Tausend Euro Kosten, und die Nachfrage betroffener junger Eltern ist riesengro?. Erste neue Audiobiografen wurden mittlerweile? ausgebildet, um der gro?en Nachfrage gerecht werden zu k√∂nnen. Leider l√§uft das gef√∂rderte Pilotprojekt im M√§rz 2020 aus und kann weiterhin nur mit freiwilligen Spenden √ºberleben und bundesweit ausgebaut werden. Mit dieser Gofundme-Aktion will ich erreichen, dass dieses wunderbare Projekt nicht nur? weiter lebt, sondern dass es auch noch ganz vielen betroffenen jungen Eltern angeboten werden kann.

My son was given a citizenship award at school and Sabumnim was so emphatic about the fact that it should be celebrated even though my son hadn?ôt mentioned it during the dojang afterschool program.Prior to joining WMAC, I?had reached out to a few schools when my son was 4 and a half years old, and they all said that they didn?ôt start training children that early. Undaunted, I came to WMAC. I?ôll never forget the day in 2015 when I came to the dojang on a Saturday afternoon and Sabumnim was just about to leave. We talked for about 45 minutes.I expressed my desire to have my son start training early, as I wished I? had, and how important it was for young Black boys to develop not just martial arts training but the discipline, awareness, and sensitivity to equip themselves for the unique challenges they would face. We were speaking each other?ôs language as Brooklyn-bred men of color. I knew this was the place for us. To my joy and surprise, the diversity of dojang students and instructors was more than I ever expected. The adaptation to needs, skill sets, and particular challenges has been a blessing and a joy. The Chungsanims even motivated me to get back to my own training regardless of my physical challenges (which had been my personal crutch for years). I can?ôt for a minute imagine what we would do without WMAC, Sabumnim and the community. #Lifechanging #necessary #cantdowithout? -KurtThe World Martial Arts Center started over 30 years ago to teach self-defense and empower women. Seeing the rapid skill development of these women, the men around them were inspired to join us. Since that time, many of the members have gotten married and had children and we created a children's program that has grown to a seven day a week program, with an emphasis on self-esteem, self-image, self-respect and self-confidence.?WMAC has received seven prestigious national top ten martial arts school awards and besides having 60% female instructors, it is one of the few schools in New York City to produce women masters in traditional Korean Hapkido and VSK Combat Street Jujitsu.This is a place where families train together, little boys learn to respect and value little girls as their equal. And little girls learn to hold their own, with complete confidence amongst any group of boys. At our school, we build character and teens respect and admire their parents.WMAC is an empowerment generating force in the community for men, women and children regardless of socio-economic backgrounds. It is a place where Black Lives Matter, where a Hasidic Jew, Egyptian Muslim, a Chinese Buddhist and an Irish Catholic can train together and bond as brothers and sisters of the human family tree.?The pandemic has decimated seventy percent of our student body which has made it impossible for us to maintain and operate our school. We are forced to leave our present location and we need your help to establish a new location and save our school. For the first time in 30 years a school that was started with $38 and no bank loans, that not only thrived but supported countless others in fulfilling their goals and life dreams, and has reached down to lift so many up now is reaching up for a hand to pull them back onto solid high ground so that we can continue being a true force for good for humanity.This is an urgent and time sensitive appeal to save our school and maintain a place of empowerment for all in these disempowering times.Your donation means so much to us and as a thank you,If you donate $50 or more you get access to a virtual beginners' guide which includes the complete beginners' program?$100 or more you get access to the virtual beginners' guide ?and the 12 guided meditations?$500 or more you get all of the above plus exclusive access to a special, live, virtual weapon training with the Grandmaster (includes five preparation videos prior to the workshop)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have technology to do this, now we need funding to make it happen. Organizers want to do this but can't afford to do this on their own.We have calculated that each new table (as most table will not be able to be retrofitted easily)will cost approximately $1000 per jump depending on lumber costs for the location. In the US we have 108 preliminary tracks, 50 Intermediate tracks and 19 Advanced tracks. In addition to this we have various FEI tracks that will also need to be factored into the mix. If we said that that there are a minimum of 2 tables per preliminary track, 3 per intermediate track and 4 per advanced track that would equate to approximately $450,000. This would be the minimum hence the target of $500,000.Initially we will be looking at table replacements with the Mims Table Kit and once this is complete our aim is to use this platform to help fund all frangible devices including Oxer, Post and Rail, gate kits for new fences.All funds received from this campaign will be given directly to organizers throughout the country who run events at the Preliminary level and above.?In an effort to begin raising funds immediately, we have an interim bank account to hold funds while we set up our own 501c3 organization as soon as possible.The Group consists of Emily Holmes and Andy Bowles as co-chairs, Robert Kellerhouse, Jon Holling, Leslie Law, Kyle Carter, Doug Payne.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As this recently happened, our plans to rebuild are not finalized and no decisions have been made. When they are, the fundraising goal will be adjusted to match what we need. What is clear is that our insurance policy will not be enough to rebuild the barn. The initial goal limit is based on our preliminary expectation of the cost. The housing corporation has not made any decisions on designs of a potential future structure.For 30 years, the Chi Phi barn has been a place for people to come together. We have used it to relax on a weekend; we have used it to bring countless Brothers into our family; we have used the barn to mourn the loss of Brothers no longer with us. We have also used the? barn to welcome thousands of friends into our home. Chi Phi Chapters across Florida and Brothers across the country have visited throughout the years. Some have stayed with us during summers, and they have left with lifelong friendships. We have hosted every Fraternity and Sorority at Florida Tech for one reason or another. For the past 30 years, we have opened our doors to you to celebrate a holiday or to toast to all of our successes after a semester, or even to sit under the shade and enjoy a beautiful day. The Chi Phi barn sat at our house, but it has lived in the hearts and memories of so many of us.I?ôm sure many of you have some great memory of a time around our barn. Maybe you heard a song that you couldn?ôt resist dancing to, or a game that you won and still talk about with old friends. The barn could have been the place where you met someone you?ôll never forget, or it could have been the place where you fell in love. We ask that you think about what the barn has given you. We understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has put many people in a less secure financial state. We ask, if you are able to do so, that you donate to help in our efforts so that thousands more can experience everything that you have, too.Any money donated through GoFundMe will go directly to funding the barn exploratory project and will not be tax-deductible.Fraternally,?The Executive Boards of XDHC and XDAAThe Xi Delta Housing Corporation (XDHC) is an organization run solely by elected alumni of the Xi Delta Chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity located in Melbourne, FL.

1275,"Balance Bicycle Shop Rebuilding, Richmond VA","Created June 1, 2020","Sports, Teams & Clubs","$45,095 ","$45,000 ",751,2.5K,753,"My name is Greg Milefsky, I am the owner of Balance Bicycle Shop. On May 30, we were the victims of vandalism and complete and total looting as a result of the riots on Broad St., the stretch of Broad St. where my shop is located. Our entire inventory was looted to include all but one of our customers bikes that were in for service (no, it's not your bike. The owner has been notified.) This includes every single wheel and small item that was brought in for service.Before going a sentence further, I must say that on May 30, 2020 I was able to come home to my kids. They came into my bed with me as I laid awake. My sister came to my house just to provide support. George Floyd would never see his kids again and his sister again. And I can't even think about this without crying. He never went home and I did. I need a moment of silence.I have been overwhelmed with support, which is amazing. Many people have offered financial support, so I made this is the GoFundMe for Balance Bicycle Shop. But don't donate to me, GoFund George Floyd and his family instead. I went home to my family and he didn't.https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloydBut, if you still want to give to Balance Bicycle Shop, know I am truly grateful. I am actually overwhelmed by emails, text messages, DMs, right now. The generosity of people who I know and love already and the cycling community in Richmond would be enough. But there is an additional outpouring of support from people who I don't know, who I have never met, who have never been in my shop, and who don't even live in Virginia. All of it is humbling.I want give a rough guidelines for what I plan do use your donations for, and the ways your donations will be used to help rebuild Balance Bicycle Shop.10% will go to Richmond Cycling Corps. They do amazing work with at risk youth in Richmond, using cycling as the tool to break down the barriers.? There is nothing more that I can say that hasn't been said or done through their work.? https://www.richmondcyclingcorps.org/Phase 1 rebuilding will start with making my existing customers who have lost their bikes in the looting whole again. Going forward, I am working with our insurance to cover customer's losses. This will take time as we get all the relevant and necessary documents. I hope to build a fund to make my customers whole and repay their loses quicker than insurance. This is Phase 1 in rebuilding, making sure my existing customers are taken care of.Phase 2 rebuilding will be to pay my employees who have no jobs now. My employees are unemployed as a result of the looting. Some of my employees have been with me for years. There is no set length of time for which I want to be able to pay them, but anything will help in a time like this.Next is Phase 3a or Phase 3b. These are speculative because they exist many months into the future. Only one scenario will prevail, and I don't know which one it will be.Phase 3a is actual rebuilding; inventory, cabinets, computers, fixtures, etc. Financially, this will largely be taken care of by insurance. It will take time, effort, man-hours and it will be a fraction of the actual loss in dollar amounts and time. I expect this insurance claim will take 12-18mo.We will not reopen in Richmond City. I can't rebuild in Richmond City. Justifiable rising tensions makes it impossible to rebuild in Richmond City. Police brutality and racism is not going anywhere and the escalating violence and tension in the city make it no longer viable for businesses. Maybe I can rebuild once, but impossible twice. It absolutely pains me to say, but the next murder of an unarmed black person is guaranteed, we just don't know who it is yet. I can't spend the next 6 months of my life rebuilding my business only to get looted again for something I have absolutely no control over.Phase 3b is the end of Balance Bicycle Shop. What happened, the looting, is not just a break-in where we lost a few bikes and otherwise able to resume business in a day or two. This is the complete gutting of my businesses inventory, tools, which we truly can't restock because of supply chain shortages. There is nothing left. We can't resume normal business before the money runs out.? UPDATE: This option was always a last resort but I wanted to be clear it was possible before money was donated.? Based on the response I've gotten from GoFundMe and through other channels, this is not an option.? Rebuilding Balance Bicycle Shop will be the way forward. ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have spent endless hours behind the scenes making it look easy for our players to get a chance to build personal connections, have a sense of play and fun in an otherwise stressful world, and most importantly get a chance to experience what it means to be part of a caring community.So many people who signed up to play football for the first time, shake the rust off their volleyball skills, or feel like a kid playing kickball in the schoolyard again, ended up finding new best friends, a real life social network, relationships, marriages (and even some babies). On top of that, we?ôve also donated over $3.5 million to charities selected by our participants.Unfortunately, as ?you?ôve seen everywhere, the effects of the COVID-19 virus on the economy have done particular harm to the service industry. ZogSports is no exception.And right now, we are asking for your help.To weather this storm, two weeks ago we were forced to furlough our team of 42 loving, caring, hard-working teammates. We are also unable to provide any work for our hundreds of part-time staff, many who rely on us to help make ends meet. Making this tough decision was the only shot we had at allowing us to come out of this crisis in one piece, bring our team back, and resume our mission of providing the games and leagues we all love, where the greater community can heal from hard times, once normalcy returns.A community is judged by how it acts in its most challenging times. So whether ZogSports has been the place you found your partner, or if it was even just a chance to smile after a stressful day, please consider giving a little back to those that love putting in the work to make that possible.We've set up this coronavirus relief fund so that our community can contribute to the financial support of the ZogSports team. Your donation will directly and immediately pay for our employees??healthcare, as well as maintaining existing overhead costs, unforeseen operating expenses, and reopening costs that will ensure our business stays afloat during this crisis.We recognize that now is a challenging time for many across the country, but if you do have the ability to give back to the ZogSports community, we hope you?ôll consider making a donation.

For the past 6 months we have been holding onto hope for a future in the same Silver Lake neighborhood that we?ôve been rooted in for 42 years.

Many members have offered to continue paying their monthly dues. We will not forget the kind gestures but felt it was not the right thing to do at the time.Going forward, we are headed into some of the toughest challenges. But we have been dragged into deep waters plenty of times. Unfortunately, we were shut down with very little assistance to continue operating when we are allowed to reopen.We understand that we are all struggling, and only ask for donations for those who can afford to do so. Most of the donations will be used towards the high sanitary expectations and cleaning products to keep our gym even cleaner than it was.

We are so lucky to have a supportive community of loyal audience members that have supported our productions for many decades. Ticket sales go towards buying and renting things for the production such as: lumber, paint, lighting equipment, lighting equipment rental, costume construction, costume rental, props, a set designer, shoes for cast members, sound equipment and microphone rental, salaries for pit musicians,? make up, wigs and so much more.

Because we will not have the chance to benefit from the SEUSSICAL ticket sales, we are looking to you, our loyal fans, to help bail us out at this time.If you have ever seen a Players production or know a Staples Player, you know the hours and hours of work and dedication that go into a production. To not be able to perform this show for an audience was devastating for students and staff alike.

Junella Sgro was getting ready to teach a fitness class when she suffered an aneurysm. Junella had an immeasurable impact on everyone she met. She always had a smile and believed the best of people. Her positive attitude and determination spoke volumes about who she was. You could not walk away, after spending time with her, without feeling that somehow your life was better for having been with her.The purpose of this GoFundMe is to enable her children to continue supporting Junella's number one passion of #SgroHockey. JT plays junior hockey in Louisiana; Josiah and Jayden play here in Austin; and Julianna plays for the Dallas Stars Elite Girls. We ask that you donate towards what Junella was the most passionate about, #SgroHockey, for her children, in lieu of flowers so that they can continue pursuing their dreams.If you knew Junella, you know why this would be the one thing she would ask for. Her children and John were her entire world, and she loved nothing more than being that quintessential hockey mom-shuttling kids to the rink, feeding them at the rink, doing homework and napping in the Sprinter (aka The SgroMobile). Our Austin hockey community cannot possibly measure the impact she has had, and we cannot express the immeasurable loss and sorrow we feel.JT, Josiah, Jayden, and Julianna will continue to play to honor their mother and the game she loved so much. It would mean the world if you can contribute towards making that happen. The best way to remember Junella is to honor what she loved the most. To Junella, John, and the kids-the Austin hockey community loves you so much. But your impact, your reach-goes far beyond Austin and far beyond hockey.?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have served children in our community since 1956. Many of the children we serve are from low income and underserved communities.?On January 24, 2020 our little league was the victim of a major theft that has left us scrambling to salvage our season.? Thieves kicked in the door to our snack shack, stripped electrical wiring, and copper water piping as well as stole our PA equipment and numerous other items. After securing the building it was again broken into with our cameras and other property stolen. At this time we have no electricity and need massive repairs to our concession stand.? Our concession stand is the life blood of Pacwest funding the majority of scholarship and loaner equipment for our players.Unfortunately, we have experienced several break-ins and cleaned up numerous vandalism incidents over the past years. Our location makes it difficult to prevent complete access to our facility because the Little League Fields sit on leased land from the Port of Seattle. While we have a gate that prevents street entry onto the property, we are in an isolated area that has minimal barriers to prevent access to it completely. We are working on getting more support from the Port to improve security measures.?We ask the community for support because while insurance will cover some of the costs, each time we are burglarized it limits our ability to focus on what is most important, providing and improving a youth sports program that serves the children in our community. We believe every child who wants to play should play. Because of our belief, we use most of our funds to give scholarships to players. In fact, we give out more scholarships than any other Little League in our region and operate within a very minimal budget so children can play with less financial burden.??We?ôre asking for your donation to help repair and replace our damaged facilities so we can start the season on time. We will use donations for the following:-Necessary repairs to the building including replacement of electrical and plumbing fixtures-Security Improvements-Replacement of Stolen equipment-Scholarships so that we can continue to provide access to youth sportsPlease help us spread the word by sharing a link to this GoFundMe page on social media or through email.?

While we have a gate that prevents street entry onto the property, we are in a somewhat isolated area that has a minimal barrier to prevent those who access it through other means. We will be looking into and speaking with the Port on what other measures can be taken to prevent access to our property.?Won't insurance cover this?Absolutely, insurance can and will cover much of the damages. However, as mentioned above, this won't be the first of our claims. Due to the frequency, we are concerned that our premiums will escalate if we have to continue to make claims. Lastly, insurance won't cover preventive measures we may need to explore that we have not yet budgeted for.?You mentioned the community you serve is one of the most economically under served, how do you know this information?We know that the majority of the kids in our program are part of the Highline School District whose student body has almost 67% of the students falling at or below the poverty level.I'd like to donate today but how can I help volunteer and/or donate on an ongoing basis?Please reach out to me directly at [email redacted]I own a company who is interested in sponsorship or in kind services that might be able to help, who do I reach out too?We appreciate each and every one of our community partners who helps us through sponsorship and/or in kind goods and services.

Throughout its 53 years of existence, Twisters has created a local reputation for providing quality instruction while maintaining a culture that stresses love of sport, a growth mindset, and community.? ? ?Unfortunately, after seven months of being unable to operate at a sustainable level, Twisters is at risk of becoming another statistic of the Covid-19 Pandemic. During the first few months, we received a lot of financial support from many of you via Zoom classes and voluntary membership payments. We truly appreciate and will never forget everyone's support during that time. During that time, Twisters also obtained a SBA PPP Loan to stay afloat and to keep key staff members employed. However, this loan will be depleted by the end of October 2020.? ? ?Currently, Twisters is in the process of relocating to 2800 Bowers Avenue, Santa Clara, CA 95051. Unfortunately, delays within the Santa Clara City Planning Department due to the pandemic and the costs associated with engineering, architectural, and permitting fees have depleted our reserves. As many of you know, it takes a lot of capital to relocate and Twisters currently owes $7,500 in Architectural Services, $1,500 for City Permitting Fees, and $1,000 for Engineering Services. These are costs that are due before the Tenant Improvement (TI) process. Additionally, we've estimated that the facility set up will cost approximately $7,500 - $10,000. Fortunately, our new landlord has agreed to install an in-the-ground pit and undertake the major tenant improvements for us. The estimated date of completion for these improvements is November 30th, 2020.?? ? ?Hopefully, at the end of this process, our intention is to reopen on Monday, January 4th, 2021. We also have plans to dissolve Twisters' current S Corporation status and create a ""new"" 501c3 nonprofit organization for Twisters to operate under. It seems to be a more suitable fit for how Twisters operates and is consistent with our community's values. If the Federal Government is unable to provide future relief for struggling businesses through a second stimulus package, then a Phase 2 Campaign will be created in order to stay open while a vaccine is developed and occupancy restrictions are lifted.

The fundamental values that are taught at the club are the same that I hold close to my heart. BHFC is an extraordinary place and I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it.

She has embraced the sport, with all the rigor and discipline that it requires, with passion. I never thought I would see this, but she can barely wait for her classes to re-start; she is very anxious to get back in the game. I?ôd like to thank the staff of the BHFC, and in particular coaches Carla and Margo, for taking my kid under their wings and shaping her into what she hopes to become, a future U.S.A. Olympian.""Camille G. 2010?""BHFC is more than just a fencing club. It changed my life. No, really. I began fencing at BHFC when I was 14 years old, and in the fencing world, that is a bit old to start to fence competitively. However, I found a family in BHFC; my coaches Carla Corbit and Margo Miller taught me life lessons and values, beyond the sport of fencing, such as discipline, integrity, and commitment. They pushed and supported me to reach my best, not only in the sport but in life. Their guidance together with my dedication led to becoming a US Squad member, representing the US in World Championships around the globe, and then ultimately, being recruited to fence in the Ivy Leagues, becoming a Columbia University Lion. I am grateful for my mother who brought me to BHFC and stuck it out with me through each tournament and even more so to Carla and Margo for all their years of being there.""Seven A. 2022""The Beverly Hills Fencing Club has become my second home. My coaches Carla and Margo have become my mentors. Fencing has turned out to be my biggest passion in life, and interesting enough I found it at a time where I thought I?ôd never find something to be truly passionate about and invested in. Now, the highlight of my day is being able to fence against my teammates and friends at the club, people who I consider family. BHFC is a place that helps me to pursue my dream.""JoLynn S. Parent""We all made lasting friendships with fencers, their parents, and the dedicated and wonderful coaches ??Carla, Margo, and Ted.

This could not be more worth your time and resources. We love them!""Louie K. 2019?""Fencing has taught me so many things and has contributed in so many ways to who I am today.

As a result, I have been a long time fencer, friend and supporter of BHFC because I have witnessed firsthand how important fencing is for building confidence, character, self discipline, and sportsmanship in fencers of all ages. Many of the kids I first fenced, have since graduated from college and have become successful young adults, partly due to coach Carla Corbit?ôs dedication to her students and to the fine art of fencing. May the Beverly Hills Fencers Club continue to thrive and perpetuate the exciting and exhilarating sport of fencing. Please help support this truly amazing organization because we love fencing and Coach Carla!""Matthew L. 2021""Fencing has been a huge part of my teenage life and I have made so many incredible friends through the sport.

David is a talented ball player with an exceptional baseball IQ and sincere love for the comradery the sport provides. His smile, upbeat spirit, and personality are contagious. It is unfathomable that he has lost both of his parents and grandmother at such a young age.Before David?ôs father, passed away, he prepared for his son?ôs life by asking his best friend?ôs family if they would care for David - and this amazing family has taken on this incredible responsibility with love and joy.David and his chocolate Labrador Winston moved in with Hudson Houmes who has been his best friend since 2nd grade. David now lives with Hudson, his sister Crosby, and their parents, Ashley and Matt (and their 2 dogs) :)They are in need of any help our Eagles family can provide. They are doing their best to make changes to their home to help David feel welcomed and equally a part of their family.

We do a lot more than that.As a Not-For-Profit organization, we are very proud to serve not only active and retired members of the Canadian Armed Forces and the RCMP, but also a wide variety of community groups, youth, and seniors. We host a variety of leagues such as darts, horseshoes, cribbage and indoor lawn bowling. We are well known in the area for our Friday night buffet, live-entertainment dance events, and Saturday morning breakfasts. Further, we are a competitively priced location for events like weddings, group fundraisers, special dinners, and other celebrations. Unfortunately, on March 23, 2020 due to the world health emergency we had to close our doors. As a Not-For-Profit organization we depend solely on revenue from bar sales, hall rentals and kitchen sales to pay operating expenses. Our Legion is administered by an elected committee of volunteers, which has worked since closing the doors to cut costs to the bare minimum, including reluctantly laying off the few paid staff and reducing utility usage wherever feasible. Even with these actions we still face costs of approximately $6,000/month, but no revenue coming in. Our Executive Committee is scared. After almost 30 years of operation, we are facing the very real threat of losing our building and our ability to support veterans and the Orleans community. Our last recourse is this appeal to the public to help us get through the mandated closure, so that we may continue to provide the services to our Orleans Community that we have become known for. Anticipating that the earliest the restrictions will be lifted is June, and knowing that July and August are historically lower income months, we have set a goal of raising $25,000 to ensure our critical bills are paid. Every dollar counts, and sharing this with your friends and family helps too.

1337,#COLORTHEWATER - ANTI-RACISM THROUGH OCEAN EQUITY,"Created July 31, 2020","Sports, Teams & Clubs","$21,866 ","$25,285 ",241,570,240,"A Color the Water Origin StoryFor a more detailed version of the CTW Origin story, please click here?.WHO ARE WE??We are #COLORTHEWATER (CTW), a small group of aspiring surfers of color offering free surf lessons and coaching for all BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) in the Greater Los Angeles Area, and creating more visibility for BIPOC surf culture.? We are creating a network of BIPOC surfers in the LA Area and around the world.?I am David Malana, founder of CTW. I am a first generation Filipino American international educator/trainer, videographer/photographer, former ball player, and surfer. CTW has set a high bar for itself, and I am proud to say that we are getting there. We need your help take the next steps though.WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? ??Fighting Stereotypes ??Creating BIPOC SpacesAt LA?ôs first paddle out honoring George Floyd?, I realized that the ocean, one of my most prized sanctuaries, is almost entirely a white space. Surfing was invented by BIPOC, but it was then commodified by colonizers, pushing BIPOC inland while tokenizing a select few as ?úexotic??surfers. This racism creates stereotypes about a relationship with water and the ocean that many BIPOC have internalized as part of their ethnic identity (""oh, we don't swim""). This? obstacle makes ocean play seem too frivolous to invest hard-earned money in. I decided to change this, and so with the help of friends and family, I started Color The Water on social media with the hashtag #colorthewater. We have been able to do a lot in two short months!WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR ??Coaching ??Media ??Surf MeetupsCTW has coached over 30 surfers to date, with over 20 more on the way. This amounts to nearly 125 private/semi-private lessons, each lasting about one to two hours (roughly $30,000 worth of coaching/rentals). Accompanying these lessons, surf coaches from Venice Beach to India have offered over fifty hours of remote and in-person video analysis like this Wave Breakdown. CTW has daily, often twice daily small surf meetups that create a safe, positive, and welcoming space for BIPOC. Our makeshift CTW HQ has helped people access the ocean with even greater ease, and we all hope one day we can have an HQ to call our own.WHY DO WE NEED FUNDS? ?î¬?Access ??100% Free Lessons ??Sustaining CTW?Getting to the beach can be time consuming and expensive. Private surf lessons can cost $150 for 1.5 hours (without media), and gear rental costs around $50. It's just too much for most people. For BIPOC, those barriers have compounded due to generations of systemic racism. That is why I am passionate about making our lessons 100% free for hopeful learners. CTW has grown such that we need help to keep the community moving forward.Money raised through this GoFundMe will go towards the following categories:?(1) Essential CTW HQ Surf Equipment (boards, +size suits, tents, etc)(2) Surf Media Equipment (camera, lenses, action camera, water-housing)(3) Surf Teacher & Videographer Compensation?(4) CTW HQ (surf, beach equipment, HQ rent)(5) CTW Surfer Kit (essential gear for progression)For full budget documentation, including community contributions and stretch-goals,?click here?.Here are some of the things our surfers have had to share about what #colorthewater?means?to them.?úCTW has helped me get over the hump by taking my skill set from beginner to intermediate.??David has a skill for seeing what I was doing wrong and articulating how to make those correction on the fly.??I?ôm happy to be a part of the CTW community.?? Nate""Color the Water has become the sacred, safe haven I always knew I needed but didn?ôt have access to until now. I finally feel like I belong in the ocean, and this community has made me feel so welcomed.""- Ludine""The CTW surfing community feels like a second family.""- Rahzizi""CTW set us up with gear and made possible what felt impossible. David was crystal clear with his explanations, and great at quickly preparing beginners at varying skill levels. I?ôll always remember the serenity of finally making it out on the water ??the setting sun painting the water orange and pink. Thank you, CTW!""- Cruz and Lila""I met David when I was struggling to keep up with more WAY more Advanced surfers than I. He asked if he could help me and I couldn?ôt say ??YES!??Fast enough. As a black woman who is new to surfing it can be very discouraging to go out on your own to learn esp when No one looks like you in the water. CTW offers all people of color a safe , friendly and comfortable environment to learn and grow as a surfer within the most? diverse surf community I?ôve ever seen. I?ôve improved in so many areas but most notably in my confidence . Definitely one of the best things to happen to me since moving to LA. ""- Erin?úIn the sea, each wave washes away all my troubles as I float and the calm comes over me. The ocean is my therapy. When I see diversity in the water, it fuels my soul to get better and better. On land I am biracial but the sea is all of me.""- Noemie?úSurfing taught me how to surrender. Color the Water creates a space for me to feel safe to do so.??- Joi K. Madison?""Color the Water is not only a movement that acknowledges systemic racism by providing equity in the water for BIPOC, but provides sanctuary to cope with community trauma during this time.""- Faith""I have no doubt you are making huge waves with Color the Water because it has been a long time coming.""- Nana, mother of Noemie, CTW Surfer""If the ocean is truly for everyone, than it's about time we open these gates for those who have not been privileged in a way that makes surfing a genuine choice, and not just an unfulfilled fantasy. Please help us break down as many barriers of entry as we can, so that BIPOC can connect back to their ancient ancestors and shift surfing from a stoic, mostly white multi-billion dollar industry ?to a shared celebration of the beauty and magic of the ocean we've been far too long kept from. Not anymore though, now it's time for us to color the water.""- David",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the oldest and last great standalone clubs left playing at state level within the VFL. Yet today our future is under challenge as never before.The Covid-19 pandemic represents the most significant threat to the foundations of our club in many years.??While we fully support the Governments' approach to limiting the spread of the virus in the community, the effects of the restrictions have postponed the season - leaving us unable to play football and unable to generate critical income in season 2020. This unprecedented situation weighs heavily on the club, with financial impacts likely to extend well into the 2021 VFL season and beyond.This presents a real challenge for our club. Without the resources of the large AFL clubs, Port Melbourne already must work harder than most to survive in today?ôs elite football landscape. It is vitally important at present that we find other ways to raise funds to help secure our foundations for the future. This will help ensure we stay independent, viable and remain a highly competitive club within the VFL well into the future.That is why we have decided to launch the Borough Future Fund. A fund established with a clear purpose to help strengthen our efforts to steer a way through the lasting financial impacts of this pandemic. And a fund designed to continue to lay the foundations for ongoing growth and development, and to set us up for lasting success on the other side of this.Many of you may know of Port and our rich history.

Some of you may never have heard of us but may just be footy fans keen to ensure the future of independent football survives in this state.??Whatever your reason, with your help we can ensure the men and the women of the mighty Borough can continue flying the flag for standalone football in Victoria for another hundred years and beyond.?WHO ARE WE?Established in 1874, Port Melbourne Football Club, known as 'The Borough' is one of the true pioneers of Australian Rules Football and pre-dates two thirds of the current AFL clubs in the competition today. For most of our 146 years we have played at the same historic oval, wearing the same vertical red and blue stripes, in front of the same passionate supporters.From our humble and rugged beginnings on the docks, Port's early history was forged in Australia's earliest football competition, the Victorian Football Association (VFA). From the halcyon days of the early and mid-twentieth century, through to a renaissance in the 21st, the Borough are steeped in determined success. An unrivalled record of 17 senior VFA/VFL premierships stands as one of the most successful records of any club in any competition.?Today we are a vibrant and inclusive community club now proudly consisting of both elite men's and women's Australian rules football teams. In 2018 we excitedly launched our very first women?ôs team, which in true Port spirit has grown from strength to strength in player development and on-field performance within the SEWFL. Port is a proud cornerstone of our local community and represents for many so much more than just a football club.? For our supporters, players, sponsors, families and friends?The Borough?is a way of life.At the outset of establishing this fund, the Port Melbourne Football Club wishes to gratefully acknowledge the generous investment in, and faithful retention of, all 2020 corporate sponsorships and memberships held by our supporters in anticipation of this season, despite the uncertainty.?Donations, of any size, will directly assist the club and ensure that we emerge with a rock solid foundation for our future.All donors go into the draw to win:* A priceless one on one with the great Gary Ayres (2x VFL Premiership Coach, 5x Hawthorn Premiership Player and 2x Norm Smith Medallist) over a two course lunch at a leading Port Melbourne eatery; or*One of three Sherrin Game Day footballs signed by Gary & the Port Melbourne Leadership Team valued at over $200 each Your support through these times is much appreciated.On behalf of the Board, Management, Players, Supporters of the Port Melbourne Football Club, thank you.?Please note, for all enquiries regarding other ways you can contribute, sponsor or assist the Club at this time, please contact our office on +61 (03) 9646 2094 or email us at: [email redacted].au",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This campaign is to request donations for our porters' living expenses while they can't work.?Enigma is based in Cusco / Peru, and has been operating treks in the Andes for almost 18 years. Anyone who has trekked the Inca Trail to Machupicchu with us may have had the chance of experiencing the hard labour of our porters, carrying all items from camp to camp, setting them up, preparing food and doing all with a big smile, gratitude and appreciation for their work. They are family to us.?Porters come from neighbouring communities and receive a wage for every trip they do. A porter with Enigma earns US$ 90.00 for his services on an Inca Trail of 4 days and 3 nights and has an average of 4 departures per month in the high season --> this gives an average monthly income of US$ 360.00, which supports his whole family. Enigma Works with a regular base of 64 porters who have seen their wages abruptly interrupted since March 16, when Peruvian borders were closed and quarantine was imposed. ?Covid has especially affected Peru, as the pandemic started right at the kick-off of our high season, which lasts from April through October (Dry Season in the Andes). This is the time of the year in which porters make their earnings, to then endure the low season. International travel will possibly not resume in Peru until October, and if it does, it may be at a shy 10% vs last year. There will be less departures to treks, with less need of porters if any. We consider this season will be lost for the travel industry in Peru, and also for them all. ?Porters are part of the low SES collectives in Peru (Poor or Extremely Poor) and are not in the capacity to ask for loans. The Government has activated several support schemes for these collectives but these are insufficient while demand is high.?Suffering from a sudden severe lack of funds, our porters are facing the following challenges as heads of their families in highland remote areas:- Food supplies: scarce due to quarantine and prices of first necessity products have increased as distribution has been reduced- Service payment (electricity and water)- School supplies: books, notebooks, folders- Means for their children to follow online schooling: public schools require that the family has at least a radio to follow classes and homework is sent via WhatsApp in communities where there is coverage --> this requires them to have a cell phone active and with enough credit to download applications and pay for data- Usual medical supplies and clothing - dry, cold/freezing season?Our proposal is to raise funds to cover the value of ONE Inca Trail departure (US$ 90.00) for each of our 64 porters. This makes a total of US$ 5760 (??5150 as we?will be?using a European bank account to receive funds).?It is just the amount of one trip, and yet it will bring enormous relief to our porters and their families.?Who is this money going to?The 64 porters in the Enigma census. The list is attached as a photo and we are happy to send the names to you. Please contact us.?How will we handle this?With the funds received, we will proceed to pay each porter as if they had arrived from another Inca Trail departure.?Our commitment as EnigmaHonesty, transparency and trust. We will share the proof of the funds reception for every porter and for donations above US$ 500 (or ??450), we will grant a 10% discount on their future Inca Trail with Enigma, whenever that may be but hopefully soon!?This won't be enough to hang on for several months and we may come back to request more funds for the months to come, but if you have 1, 5, 10 dollars or of course more and wish to help, please donate. You will be helping not just the porters but entire families, and you will help make a huge difference to their lives during these months.?With immense appreciation and thanks on behalf of all at Enigma,?Silvia RicoCEOEnigma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We need YOUR support to enable these families to continue to feed their children, give them a roof over their head and to get them through these difficult times.?We highly appreciate any donation, but instead of writing thank-you notes, we would like to do more for our donors, for a full list please see ""Why should I donate?"".THE BACKSTORYWe as a kitesurfing camp have made a conscious decision from the first day of our existence to outsource services to the surrounding village so that many families participate and benefit from the tourism income. This means that we buy our food from the farmers and fishermen of the village and we don?ôt own any trucks, vans or boats, all this is provided by the village and gives 60 families in Kalpitiya a livelihood. But due to the worldwide situation caused by the coronavirus, tourism has come to an abrupt stop. More and more countries are closing their borders, airlines drastically reduce their flights and the Sri Lankan government has put the whole country on lockdown. Hard times are dawning for us. During the bombing in April 2019 we were able to compensate for our loss with our savings, but this year we are forced to take more drastic measures. Without tourists, we have no income and without income, we can't sustain our employees in the coming months.?WHERE ARE WE?Kitesurfing Lanka is located in Kalpitiya, North-Western part of Sri Lanka, on the Puttalam Peninsula. Kitesurfing Lanka is one of the top locations in the kitesurf world and has changed a little fishing village into a Kitesurf hot spot which is very common for international tourists and professional kitesurfers.?OUR IMPACTKitesurfing Lanka has been in operation for just over 8 years now. The company has transformed the community of Kalpitiya for the better. In fact, Kalpitiya is considered one of the top destinations for the sport of Kitesurfing! Our story just does not stop here, countless lives have been transformed through this business. People both here and abroad found purpose, love, pursued their passions and even were inspired to start their own businesses both in Sri Lanka and overseas. Our company paved the way for a new way of doing business with Sustainability at the helm of its business. We have set up many sustainability projects for the environment. For example mangrove planting and plastic upcycling, projects which we would like to sustain.??THE GOALOur goal is to be able to continue to sustain our employees and their families in the coming months. As tourism will be impacted for at least 6 months, we need ??0.000 to support these families.?WHY SHOULD I DONATE?Not only will you become our hero, but you will enable Kitesurfing Lanka to continue its legacy and sustain our staff and their families, and keep this unique paradise open to the world.This is not just a normal fundraiser, we will give back to our donors in the following way:We hope that you can find it in your heart to help us save Kitesurfing Lanka.Spread your help & love out in the world and share this fundraising with everyone you know, especially your passionate kitesurf friends. If you can not make a donation but still would like to help, please share this fundraiser on your personal social media.?Your kindness and generosity will never be forgotten. We will try to remain positive and look forward to the day where we can kite together once more.Thank youDil, Leo & all families from Kitesurfing Lanka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Da Italien innerhalb der EU besonders stark betroffen ist, sind hier auch die Ma?nahmen zur Eind√§mmung von covid-19 sehr streng. Alle diese Ma?nahmen sind richtig und notwendig, aber sie bedrohen die Existenz unserer Tauchbasis.?Noch vor kurzem hatten wir die Hoffnung, an Pfingsten arbeiten zu k√∂nnen.

Und das in einer von vornherein zeitlich begrenzter Saison.?Wann Italien und unsere Insel Giglio wieder f√ºr den Tourismus ge√∂ffnet werden und unter welchen Bedingungen, das ist momentan nicht abzusehen ... Anders sieht es mit den trotzdem anfallenden Rechnungen aus. Unsere laufenden Kosten, wie z.B. Miete und Versicherungen, belaufen sich auf ca. 35 000 ??Jahr. ?Geld, welches wir dieses Jahr offensichtlich nicht mit unserer Tauchbasis erarbeiten k√∂nnen. Zudem sind die Staatshilfen in Italien sehr begrenzt und k√∂nnen gr√∂?tenteils nicht in Anspruch genommen werden. Auch die Aufnahme eines Kredits oder der Verkauf von Tauch-Gutscheinen w√ºrde unser Problem nur verschieben, aber nicht l√∂sen.?Damit wir auch in Zukunft f√ºr euch da sein k√∂nnen und gemeinsam tolle Tauchg√§nge und sch√∂ne Abende auf Giglio erleben d√ºrfen, bitten wir euch uns finanziell unter die Arme zu greifen.

Considerato che tra gli stati dell?ôUE l?ôItalia risulta essere uno dei paesi pi√π colpiti, anche le misure di contenimento del virus Covid-19 sono alquanto severe. Tutte queste misure sono naturalmente giuste e necessarie, ma stanno mettendo a rischio la sopravvivenza stessa del nostro centro di immersioni.?Fino a qualche tempo fa, avevamo ancora la speranza di poter lavorare nel periodo di Pasqua e Pentecoste. Ora invece √® chiaro che le misure generali di contenimento adottate non verranno allentate tanto velocemente e che questo ci priver? di una significativa parte del nostro ricavo annuale. Senza contare una stagione di per s√® gi? abbastanza limitata in termini di tempo.?Quando l?ôItalia e la nostra splendida Isola del Giglio riapriranno al turismo e quali saranno le nuove condizioni che dovranno essere rispettate per poter riaprire, questo non ci √® ancora dato da sapere... Ci√≤ che √® certo per√≤ sono che bollette e fatture sono comunque da pagare.

The subsequent decline in the number of guests and tourists and the resulting financial losses have still not been overcome.?2020 ??It is the turn of Coronavirus, which led to global health and financial problems. Since Italy is one of the most affected nation among the other EU countries, the measures currently in force to contain the spread of COVID-19 are very strict. All these measures are right and necessary, but they are seriously threatening the existence of our diving center.?Until a short while ago we were still convinced we could start working again at Easter and Pentecost. Now it is clear that the general measures will last much more than expected and that will deprive ourselves of a significant part of our annual revenues. Moreover, we are speaking of a season which is from the outset already timely limited.?The day and the kind of conditions under which Italy and our Giglio Island will be opened again to Tourism are at the moment unknown... But what is clear and certain are the bills that still have to be paid. Our running costs ??i.e. rent and insurance ??amount to approximately 35,000 ??year. ?Money, which this year we clearly could not earn from the activities of our diving center. In addition,? government aids in Italy are very limited and not accessible to everyone. Also the possibility of a loan or of selling prepaid diving vouchers would not solve our problems but just postpone them.?In order to have the chance in the future to dive together again and spend great time on the Giglio Island, we ask you to assist us with a little economic help.

It has not only returned in the areas that have been affected before but also in new areas. It seems that the immunotherapy that she was on had a rare effect, called hyper-progression, and caused her cancer to multiply rapidly. Brittany's doctor informed us that there is not a known cure for Brittany.The doctor did suggest that Brittany could begin a new round of chemotherapy. They have seen good results with these chemos after hyper-progression. The goal would be to slow the growth of her cancer and give Brittany relief from the swelling and pain in her neck.?As soon as Brittany's doctor shared the news, Brittany let us know that she is realistic and understands where things are but that she continues trusting in God and asking for a miracle of healing. Our family will continue trusting God. Brittany and I remind each other and our kids to live each day with eternity in mind. We are practicing to live each day in God's Kingdom by following Jesus. We know that this life is very temporary. Friday's news has been the hardest for us to hear and now share with you. Thank you for the love you have shown to our family over this last year. We have been continually overwhelmed with gratitude for your gifts, food, time, texts, emails, and encouragement. Please continue to pray with us, asking God for Brittany to be healed.

Das heisst konkret, dass wir auch Randregionen in Zusammenarbeit mit den dort ans√§ssigen Bauern und B√§uerinnen in die Programme eingebaut haben, also mit Menschen die sonst nicht vom Tourismus profitieren w√ºrden.

That was when my most efficient means of communication was sending letters through the mail to my parents Christmas card list.!

Well sad news... The X4 has seen better days. Trust me, I've put countless hours into troubleshooting error codes, chasing down wiring issues, and getting pushed or towed back home. The motors and gearboxes were there last things to go, so the X4 is currently in pieces, being repaired, and parts are getting expensive and hard to find.?So it seams like a good time, to put the X4 on the shelf and get a new,? reliable, more efficient all terrain chair.Enter: The X8.????It's the newest 4x4 all-terrain wheelchair made by Magic Mobility.?Same basic setup as mine, just improved chassis, motors, batteries, and electronics.With a price tag of $13,000, it's not something I can afford without your help, and having a reliable all-terrain wheelchair enables me to do so much more than I could with just my manual chair.Full transparency, the purchase price varies from dealer to dealer and is between $13,000 and $17,000.

If you have visited the island then you can attest; it is understandable that the country has taken these precautions given their limited health infrastructure.With the months of December through June being the time of year when guides make the majority of their income for the year, the timing of this viral outbreak could truly not be worse.With so much uncertainty surrounding the spread of the virus, we understand that a donation at this time may be a lot to ask. However, we know that many anglers have a special connection to the island and especially Biita and his guide crew. For that reason, we wanted to make sure you had a way of helping them make it through the summer until regular service is (hopefully) returned to the island. All funds collected are set up to go to Brian Gies (Fly Water Travel - Director of Travel Operations). Then Fly Water Travel is wiring 100% of these fund directly to Bita's Kirabati bank account, just as we do for normal lodge operations.

The dive industry is just one of these industries and given that diving is strongly linked to the ability to travel internationally ??which as we all know ended abruptly. The Cayman Islands took the decision to close their ports (air and sea) in a largely successful bid to contain the virus spread. But since the customers have stopped coming the dive operations in Grand Cayman have been out of the water for weeks. Many have not survived and have pulled their boats out of the water for the very last time. There is no immediate prospect of customers returning until restrictions can safely be lifted and even then not until consumer confidence in air travel and ultimately their destinations being safe to travel to is restored. Things are looking bleak in the short term. We will all come through the other side of this situation, but the world will have changed in many ways and in order to preserve those things we love, we need to support our local businesses if we wish to have them there, waiting for us, when we choose to return.To this end we want to ask for your help in preserving a company (and its employees) that has been at the heart of the dive industry here in Grand Cayman for the past 30 years. Off The Wall Divers is a small team ??6 lovely people in all ??who have been running a great little dive operation with small groups of divers, many of them customers for years. This small ?úfamily??have found themselves high and dry during these past few weeks. In some cases, going home was not an option, so staying put was the only way forward. But without income they are all feeling the bite. Times are really tough right now. If and when this island comes back online, and it will, there will be costs involved with getting the business back up and running. Work permits, putting boats back into service, making sure every aspect of this business is safe and ready for its customers will all cost money. We know that all of you have been giving to many good causes ??but now we are asking you to donate whatever you can to help keep this great little company and staff stay afloat (pardon the pun). Whether it be the price of a 2-tank dive or a cup of coffee ??whatever you can give will be so appreciated. Please help these people be there for you.

For decades our dedicated volunteers have worked hard to ensure that we can be a self sufficient and sustainable railway during normal times, sadly these are not normal times.To ensure that our skilled team can continue with projects for visitors to enjoy, like the restoration of Horden and Marley Hill engine shed, once the coronavirus outbreak is under control, we need your support. Right now we would normally be welcoming hundreds of passengers every week. Our only source of regular income comes from passengers who buy tickets to ride our trains. Without any income there is a real risk that our restoration projects may have to be delayed further, even when our volunteers begin working regularly again. Those of you who have known the railway for a while will know that we don't often ask for donations, but these are very different times and without any source of income from passengers travelling on our trains there is a real risk our restoration projects could be delayed by lack of funding. We really do appreciate any donation you can make in these challenging times. And because we rely so much on our dedicated volunteers, your donations will make a huge difference to the outcome of the heritage we all care about.A message from Tanfield Railway Trust Chairman, Derek Smith:'I know that lots of you have enjoyed visiting us before the coronavirus outbreak took hold. Perhaps riding on our North Pole express trains or visiting one of our events. The income from those trains is the only source of funding that makes the Tanfield Railway we all know and love possible. With our railway currently closed to the public due to this pandemic, we face uncertain times. Any support you can give during these challenging times will help us to preserve the rich heritage of the north east's minor and industrial railways for future generations.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While most porters are subsistence farmers, the bulk of their income comes from assisting visitors as they track the mountain gorillas of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. The salary and tips they receive help them feed their families, send their children to school and even save for a larger plot of land or to open a small shop.

We'd like to ask our trade partners and their past and current travelers around the world to consider assisting us in these efforts. CAS is donating the vehicle, fuel, driver salary and stipend for the multi-day trip to Bwindi and back.

As a result, most of our staff will have little to no income during the summer and maybe longer.?

We hope to pay each crew member $50. It may not sound like much, but $50 is enough for each person to feed and sustain him- or herself and their extended family for one month. Our crews are not looking for a hand out; they are more than happy to work for payment. So in return, we will sponsor a multi-day clean-up project on Mount Kilimanjaro. This initiative aligns with one of our core principles - to promote environmentally responsible enjoyment of the outdoors.? Our staff will remove trash and human waste around the park to keep the mountain pristine and beautiful for all future visitors.Please consider donating to our guides, cooks and porters. We are collecting donations through this GoFundMe campaign. Our goal is to raise $10,000.

It will be immediately distributed by our local partners in Nepal, Indonesia and Tanzania as these communities need our support straight away. Since launching this appeal we have since committed to supporting additional families in Colombia, Peru and Rwanda. It's likely we'll be adding more projects soon.?A little goes a long way: in Nepal just ¬£25 provides enough food and essentials for one person for an entire month - ¬£100 for a family of 4.Every penny on top of our ¬£10,000 raised on GoFundMe will help us to support these many families who need us now more than ever.?1) 25 families in Nepal?Our local partners Freedom Adventures employs 25 full-time local guides and porters, and supports young locals to build careers in responsible tourism.How the COVID-19 pandemic has affected NepalNepal is currently closed to tourism. The government of Nepal has currently stopped issuing on-arrival tourist visas to all nationalities. The direct impact has been felt by the trekking guides, porters and their families who depend entirely on income from adventure tourism. Bear in mind, trekking in Nepal is seasonal and what these hosts and porters earn in-season is typically what they live off for the whole year.?How will the money be spent?A little goes a long way. ¬£25 provides enough food and essentials for a whole month for one family member - ¬£100 for a family of 4. ¬£2500 would be just enough to support these 25 families for the 4 months that they anticipate needing help.?A word from the ground in Nepal?úThese are very difficult times, especially for us in the tourism industry. From our perspective, we also do not think it is going to get much better anytime soon. Most of our clients are from Europe, which was the hardest hit by this virus. We can only go so long without earning an income. We aim to provide for 12 trekking guides, 6 assistant guides and 7 porters and their families. Many of the Freedom staff who work in the field (as a guide, assistance guide or porter) have progressed through the Freedom Social Foundation. This means that they are at very beginning of their career and from the rural area of Nepal, so they are not financially able to sustain their family. From our perspective, helping these individuals is our number one priority, and of course, any assistance will be greatly appreciated.??- Jagan at Freedom Adventures.?2) 80 families in IndonesiaOur local partners Wicked Adventures supports 80 families and indigenous communities in Indonesia through adventure tourism .?How the COVID-19 pandemic has affected IndonesiaIndonesia is currently closed to tourism. There is no other support provided by the Indonesian government at this time beyond cutting tax obligations. As a result, many businesses have closed and the rebound will likely be slow. Wicked Adventures have had to suspend all operations until later this year with all staff on just partial salaries for the next three months. With depleted cash reserves after July, Indonesian law dictates that all staff contracts will need to be officially terminated.?How will the money be spent?¬£4,500 will help the 80 affected families to get food, essential supplies, childcare needs and medicines for a month. Just ¬£40 can support a family of 4 for a month. That's a big bag of rice, noodles, eggs, cooking oil and some basics.?A word from the ground in Indonesia?úWe are used to complications and challenges, but not one like this. We have been through tsunamis, bombings, repeated volcanoes, earthquakes, riots and coups. We are resilient??and hopeful. We can and will come back in one form or another. All of us are also passionate about sharing our part of the world. This is also one of the very few sources for income in the remote communities where we operate. With all tourism and all the related income gone all donations will be going directly to supporting those in need with food, supplies, childcare needs and medicines. Our business will rebound, we will find a way but that is a matter for the future. Right now, all our efforts are finding ways to make sure these remote places are supported. The need is far greater than we expected.??- Paul at Wicked Adventures.?3) 20 families in TanzaniaOur local partners Trek2Kili supports 20 local porters and their families and have pioneered ethical tourism in Tanzania to ensure their fair and ethical treatment.How the COVID-19 pandemic has affected TanzaniaKilimanjaro porters face the prospect of having no climbers this season. They also do not have access to the types of benefits we in other parts of the world might take for granted: severance, paid leave, unemployment insurance or even healthcare.?How will the money be spent??Trek2Kili are setting up a sustainable agriculture project to give the 20 local porters an acre of land each to cultivate for their families. The goal is to rent one acre of farmland to produce 25 sacks of maize to eat and to sell which would then support a family for over three months. The setup of all this would be ¬£350 per family and include land rental, tools, maize seeds, fertiliser, pesticides and irrigation facilities.??A word from the ground in Tanzania?úWe are feeling for everyone during this unimaginable time in life when the future is so uncertain, particularly for our poor porters. We can help our porters to diversify their income by enabling them to cultivate sustainable crops like maize, beans and sunflower. This project can save 20 families of porters that we have identified are in great need of immediate help. These 20 porters have more than 100 members of those families. Distribution of funds will be made according to the financial status of porters??family.??- Iza at Trek2Kili.4) 32 families in ColombiaOur local partners Expedition Colombia have identified 32 families who need help. These families are involved in local guiding, transportation, housing, food and logistics of adventures we run in the country.How the COVID-19 pandemic has affected ColombiaNearly 60% of Colombia?ôs workers, now on full lockdown, are paid cash in hand and usually living day to day.??The pandemic has hit the pockets of the country?ôs most vulnerable and government support has not yet reached these remote communities. How will the money be spent?Our local partner will provide relief packages for individual families based on their requirements worth USD$70/month per family, for at least 2 months. Our partners have established a list of remote families most in need of supplies from the city, and asked them what they need most. Supplies required include medicines, fishing supplies, clothes, boots, machetes and batteries.?A word from the ground in Colombia""We have been hit to a dead stop as many others, and the situation is of course concerning. We put the company on hold, after paying everyone for an extra month and vacation time as well to fully stop operating and bring the fix cost to a minimum?to focus more on conservation issues and helping others. It has been very challenging but we are making sure everyone still has enough income to live without grinding on their savings. The situation in Colombia is hard as many people live on a day to day basis and the government has not been offering any help at all. We are on day 39 of full lock-down and a small but growing part of the population is getting hungry. It would be amazing to be able to provide some kind of relief package for the local people who normally work with us in tourism and host / provide logistics for the trip we run together. They are all victims of the civil war in Colombia and tourism was a great source of hope and sustainable income for them, which greatly helped the reconciliation and peace process in the area."" - Jules, Expedition Colombia.??5) 20 Families in the Northern Peruvian AndesOur local partners in Peru have identified 4 Guides, 6 Camp Cooks and 10 Arrieros (Horsemen) who need our support while their main income via adventure tourism has been paused.How the COVID-19 pandemic has affected PeruThe people who live near the Peruvian mountain ranges in the north of Peru mostly depend on tourism. During the trekking season (mid-April to September), they work as: Guides, Porters, Cooks and Arrieros - the rest of the year they work in their small farms. With the money they earn working in tourism they buy the products that they do not produce and cover the education and health expenses of their families. Due to coronavirus these families are struggling to find alternative income with a national lockdown being in force since mid-March.How will the money be spent?The local guides, camp cooks, arrieros and their families are turning to farming after losing their key source of income from tourism. They need money to buy items that they do not cultivate, such as: rice, sugar, oatmeal, oil and salt and other essential supplies. USD$2,000 split among 20 families provides USD$100 per family (of 5 members on average) which can support each for at least one month.?A word from the ground in the north of the Peruvian Andes?úWe knew that the tourism field is very sensitive, and it could affect the tourism; but we never imagined it could stop the world.? The 2020 season was promising, but from one moment to the next our plans changed. There is a saying that says: that storms do not last forever, we are sure that the good times will return, we will walk again, we will climb new and more summits, this is just a pause; our wish and will to continue taking visitors to the mountains are the same as the last years.? Hugs adventurers friends?? - Christian at Go2Andes.?6) 44 Families in the Sacred Valley Region, Cusco, Peru?Our local partners, Action Peru Treks, in Cusco, Peru have identified 308 people from 44 families in need of support following the pause in trekking holidays being run due to COVID-19.?How the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the trekking industry around Machu Picchu, Peru?Since the borders of Peru were proactively closed on March 16, 2020, there have been zero treks and tours in the Cusco and Sacred Valley region. Travel is booked far in advance for signature treks like the Salkantay Trek. All of the work that porters, guides, horsemen, etc. were counting on to be able to provide for their families has vanished. The high season in Peru is May through October. These months have been completely lost. The earliest that Machu Picchu could open would be October; however, we would not be surprised if there is no tourism at all until 2021. Like everyone else, it is a case of hoping for the best and planning for the worst. How will the money be spent? ¬£3493 will support 308 people (44 families with an average household size of 7) for three months. The money will be used to buy and distribute food to the staff. Staff and their families need the following staples: rice, noodles, beans, oil, tuna, milk, and sugar. We are aiming to provide this sustenance for each family to have enough food for three months. Due to the remarkable resourcefulness of these families, a family of seven in the Sacred Valley can subsist on ¬£27 per month. To date, Action Peru Treks has been providing this food but are no longer able to do this. A word from the ground in the Sacred Valley, Cusco, Peru?úThe Peruvian government has been very proactive in the steps they took to combat the coronavirus. We have mandatory curfews and quarantines. In the Cusco region, tourism is the lifeblood of the economy. The Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu region provides a living for my staff and their families. With no end in sight to the closure of the country?ôs border, my staff is doing anything and everything they can to make ends meet. Our head driver is selling wine and Pisco (Peru?ôs national drink) on the side of the road. Other staff members are working odd construction jobs or trying to do some small farming. Now in the fifth month of this lockdown, the outlook is becoming desperate. These are individuals who are urgent to work, and they are dealing with feelings of shame as well for needing to depend on others to feed their families. I am doing everything I can to help them, but I no longer have the funds to support these 44 families.??- Roxner Cardenas, Action Peru Treks.TimescalesFunds lodged with GoFundMe are immediately accessible, so we have been distributing donations as we go.A massive, massive thank youIf you drop some money into this relief fund, we can't thank you enough.?We know our community spirit is strong: we saw that very recently with people raising thousands of pounds for all sorts of important causes by using our?guide to summiting mountains on their staircases.?We hope we can lean on your fantastic generosity and citizenship once more.?By helping these families we are also helping to preserve these amazing destinations that we hope we can all go back to sometime soon. These families are the stewards of the wild places we love to visit, and getting them back up and running is vital to supporting local conservation and bio-diversity.?If you?ôd like any more information about this relief fund, please feel free to contact us.?Thank you so much.Alex, Sam and Guy and the Much Better team",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ik start vandaag een nieuw avontuur, dat ik dolgraag met jullie wil delen. We gaan samen varen voor een hoger doel! Kom je mee aan boord?Met heel veel plezier verwelkom ik jullie heel binnenkort aan boord van de ecologische salonboot RFA Sir Tristram III voor een onvergetelijke ontdekkingstocht op de Vlaamse wateren. Deze oude reddingssloep van 10,5 meter met een rijke geschiedenis (het logistieke moederschip van de Britse marine werd namelijk ingezet tijdens oa. de Falkland-, Balkan en Golfoorlog), gaat nog niet op pensioen: we gaan haar helemaal opknappen!Er is nog wel wat werk en geld nodig om de boot te renoveren! De volledige vloer werd ondertussen reeds vernieuwd, de oude dieselmotor werd vervangen door een gloednieuwe fluisterstille elektromotor die zal worden aangedreven door 1.800kg aan battery power, er werd urenlang geschuurd en geverfd. Nu moeten we nog een regencover aankopen en willen we een buitenkeuken installeren om straks onze gasten aan boord culinair te kunnen verwennen... Kortom: het wordt nog een spannend avontuur...Daarom doe ik hier een warme oproep aan jullie, en uiteraard: voor wat, hoort wat!?Vanaf 15 augustus willen we beginnen te varen in Vlaanderen (uitvalsbasis Antwerpen) en in ruil voor jouw donatie verwelkomen we je heel graag aan boord!Jouw bijdrage van 40 euro geeft recht op een plaatsje aan boord voor √©√©n persoon tijdens √©√©n van onze trips (2u varen - normale prijs 50 euro).Betaal je 400 euro, dan geeft dit recht op de exclusieve huur van de boot voor een vaart van 2 uur met maximum 12 passagiers (normale prijs 500 euro). Your boat = your party! Dit wordt jouw 'Corona-proof varende bubbel' in de mooie Vlaamse natuur.Wil je sponsor/partner worden en wil je jouw bedrijfslogo op de boot? Dan betaal je 1500 euro + BTW per jaar, inclusief 1 priv√©-vaart van 3u voor 12 personen. Jouw bedrijfslogo van 50cm op 50cm krijgt een mooie plaats op de romp van het schip, want iedereen mag weten dat je dit duurzame project een warm hart toedraagt!Iedereen die langs deze weg een pr√©-reservatie maakt, bedanken we bijkomend graag met een drankje aan boord!Uiteraard zijn ook vrijblijvende donaties, hoe groot of klein ook, meer dan welkom. Wil je graag een factuur, dan bezorgen we die graag!Tijdens al mijn avonturen en wereldreizen heb ik mij steeds laten inspireren door mens en natuur. Het hogere doel is voor mij heilig in het leven. Daarom koppel ik 10% van de omzet van alle vaarten aan projecten die bijdragen aan de 17 duurzame ontwikkelingsdoelstellingen van de Verenigde Naties. Dit is mijn manier om mijn steentje bij te dragen aan een betere wereld.In 2010 ben ik de Atlantische Oceaan in 109 dagen overgevaren in een roeiboot, ten voordele van Artsen Zonder Grenzen. Om dit avontuur te helpen financieren, liepen we de 100km Dodentocht achterwaarts in een plastic rubberbootje. De transatlantische overtocht hebben we zelf gefilmd en dat leverde een vijfdelige reportagereeks op die werd uitgezonden op de tv-zender 2BE (foto: HUMO).?Mijn volgende avontuur leidde me in drie jaar op een zeilboot doorheen de vijf continenten onder het motto ?òAround The World in 80 Dates?? Met een knipoog naar Jules Vernes maakte ik kennis met de verschillende culturen in de wereld. Het ontdekken van de diversiteit in tradities, gemeenschappelijke waarden en uitdagingen, maakten van deze reis de meest waardevolle ervaring van mijn leven (foto: Wannes Van Giel).Ik ondernam ondertussen ook een tiental transatlantische overtochten met zeilboten, telkens met een andere bemanning, en losgekoppeld van iedere vorm van standaardcommunicatie met de rest van de wereld. Ik liet bedrijfsleiders het leven ervaren zonder e-mails, telefoons en vergaderingen gedurende een volledige maand, met enkel water om ons heen.Tijdens de corona crisis startte ik met mijn eigen Facebook platform ?òCrescendo - Vraagt hulp, geeft hulp?? In een mum van tijd slaagden we erin om meer dan 2300 mensen, vaak hulpbehoevende senioren, praktisch te helpen of moreel te steunen, en dit enkel met regionale vrijwilligers en met de steun van het gemeentebestuur van Zoersel.?òCrescendo??is mijn levensmotto. Ik ga er van uit dat alles bereikbaar is in functie van de kracht van de wil en het doorzettingsvermogen. Met dit project word ik plots ondernemer, maar het neemt niet weg dat ik altijd het hogere doel wil nastreven.?Maar ik wil vooral ook mensen ontmoeten, luisteren naar verhalen en mij blijvend laten inspireren. En dat in het center van mijn passie: op het water! Maar nu eerst alle hens aan dek om alles klaar te krijgen tegen midden augustus!Heel veel dank voor jullie support, op welke manier dan ook, en heel graag tot binnenkort aan boord!XChristophe[email redacted]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of our staff are single parents, parents with young children and children with special / medical needs. Some of our nannies are much worse off than others with no husband or family support at all. Some children have medical needs that need to be attended to first.We have had lots of offers of help for our ladies and their children from their wonderful customers. This has prompted us to start this fundraiser to enable you to help them if you feel you would like to. In addition to this fundraiser, all booking deposits for imminent bookings that are forfeited, will be spread evenly among our staff.We have also privately contributed to these 30+ families to ensure we help them in the best possible way. We built this business because we love it .... not because we need it. The welfare of our staff is the most important thing to us. We love each and every one of them!! ?§Ô?We are all hearing this could last 4 ??6 months and that is just devastating for the people of our beloved Bali. Our first priority is to ensure that our ladies and their children are looked after and they are able to buy basic needs for their children over the coming 4-6 months. The prospect of finding any work on an island geared towards tourism is now non-existent. Most food and basic supplies will start to run short as they are imported and there are no pricing restrictions when that food becomes available. Medical facilities will soon be under pressure and those who can pay, will always get first preference.After discussing it with the nannies this week, it is best for all donations to be spread around evenly between the staff. ALL donations will distributed to the team.Any small amount that you feel you would like to contribute would be greatly appreciated !Your BBB team x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As you may know I work at ArrKann RV and I have been friends with Lindsay Lord since high school (she said I wasn't allowed to say how long it has been since we graduated but it starts with a 2 and ends with a 0)! ?If you know Lindsay you will know she has three great kids and one of them is her hilarious little warrior Declan! I will put a little bit about Declan's health challenges below.? Declan really wants to go camping and we at ArrKann worked with Make-a-Wish to get him a tent trailer but we are realizing now that he needs an actual travel trailer to make camping a bit easier for him (see below for details). If you can help out, we would really appreciate it! Lindsay didn't want me to fundraise for her but I think we can make it so there is no cost to her to upgrade from the tent trailer to a travel trailer (their family has been through enough). ?ArrKann RV is contributing towards the trailer, and if we hit our goal of $5000, I will kick in the remaining $2500! Thanks for you time! Anything over our goal will go to helping Lindsay pay for campgrounds and fuel for their trips! Here is a little bit more about Declan.Diagnosed at 10.5 months with astrocytoma spinal cord tumors, and having relapsed twice, Declan has had two major spinal cord surgeries, and high dose radiation and has had 14 major surgeries and over 60 procedures. He has spent his entire 11 years of life in and out of the hospital (over 800 days spent in the hospital). Declan has had multiple other surgeries, including a mitrofanoff, cecostomy button, muscle lengthening, and finger amputation. He is considered a paraplegic. It hasn?ôt been an easy road, but he continues to do it with a smile and brave face.His greatest love (other than sledgehockey) is camping. He was graciously given a tent trailer so he could escape away and do what he loves. He is absolutely ecstatic about his gift, as is his family. They were able to try it out and unfortunately discovered with all of his needs the tent trailer is just not going to work for Declan. Without getting into too much detail, Declan requires alot of bathroom care and privacy for 1.5 hours every morning, as well as help throughout the day with his toileting needs. He also requires an a/c, as he has horners syndrome, a condition in which prevents his body from cooling itself down and can result in seizures should he overheat. Also the width of the tent trailer door isn?ôt quite wide enough to fit his wheel chair inside whereas with a larger travel trailer it will fit!It is for these reasons that we want to get Declan into a travel trailer, with air conditioning and a fully functions bathroom, to help him go camping and have fun!Thanks for you time!

The guides and camp staff rely almost completely on the income they receive from assisting visitors as they explore Morocco and share their boundless enthusiasm and expertise in this fascinating country. The salary and tips they receive help them feed their families, send their children to school, and help pay for any social service needed such as medical care. Without tourists, they have no income stream and as the guides often are not affiliated with any official organizations, they are not receiving support or salaries during this time. March and April are typically their busiest season but COVID 19 has abruptly cut off their means of support.Wilderness Travel and our partners on the ground are organizing emergency financial relief to our amazing local guides, who lead our groups throughout Morocco and the hardworking Sahara desert camp crew who take such good care of our groups. We are hoping our past guests who visited Morocco will consider assisting us in these efforts. We?ôre asking for your help with donations to each of our camp staff and local guides. Our goal is to raise $6,000 USD.At the end of July, Moroccans celebrate their most important religious festival, Aid-el-Kebir (the ?úbig feast?? to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Often called the Moroccan Thanksgiving, it is a time for families to get together and share special meals, often including lamb with couscous, over the course of three days. Parents also buy new clothes for their children to wear during the celebration and beyond. The Aid expenses typically run about $200-$300 for a family of 4. Wilderness Travel hopes to raise enough money in time to help the camp crew and our local guides celebrate their Thanksgiving this year.WT is not an NGO, nor do we have a non-profit arm, so these donations will not be tax-deductible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jan plans on creating a multi-media portfolio that will consist of: a film chronicling their experience as sailors, students and volunteers carrying out conservation efforts; a multi-episode YouTube series on the challenges that arise when living on a sailboat; and finally a photography portfolio documenting the beautiful, chaotic, scary, tranquil, dirty, exhausting and breathtaking experiences of sailing the sea.We need your help to make our dream a reality.? ? ?When on the water for that amount of time it's inevitable that things will go wrong.

The Chumbe Island Coral Park in Zanzibar/Tanzania is one of those affected.Nearly 30 years ago, this non-profit project was founded as the world's first privately managed marine and forest sanctuary, with a species-rich coral reef and one of the few remaining semi-arid coastal virgin forests in East Africa.For decades Chumbe has been very successful, becoming the first protected area in the world to fully finance park management from funds generated by sustainable ecotourism; with the seven-bungalow ecolodge on the island generating funds for all conservation operations and an extensive environmental education programme for fishermen, schools, officials and the local population.Now suddenly all our visitor bookings have been cancelled, all flights to Tanzania have been suspended until further notice, all our income has gone, and it is not yet possible to predict what COVID-19 will mean for the population and economy of the country. Yet work must continue to protect this vital park. The species-rich coral reef provides an essential fish nursery supporting increased yields for neighboring fishing grounds; which are more important than ever just now to ensure food security for local people. Our rangers, themselves former fishermen, have successfully protected this area around the clock since the project began almost 30 years ago, resulting in Chumbe being one of the best preserved and richest reefs in the region, with 59 coral species and more than 500 documented fish species. The island's virgin forest is home to endangered species, such as the Aders??duikers antelope and is an important sanctuary for the world's largest living land crab, the Coconut crab, which is the focus of a current research project.We have 43 local employees in our Chumbe Team, many of whom have been with us since the project began. On average, each of these team members supports 12 relatives, including family members and associated community members. Like a family, the team has overcome many challenges in the past, but COVID-19 has hit them particularly hard. The team are committed to continue their work where possible, even though salaries have withered, and they will find it hard to provide the barest essentials for their families. We need your support, not only to keep operations going, but also to ensure all team members continue to have health insurance for themselves and their families through this crisis. Please help us to continue to protect this park for future generations, and support the team through this critical period.Money raised on GoFundMe will help us to cover the following (until end of December 2020):??Guarantee continued day and night ranger patrols to protect the reef sanctuary and forest reserve.??Stipend support for all of the Chumbe Team to cover bare essentials for their families in lieu of salaries.??Coverage of full health insurance for all team members and their families for as long as the crisis persists.Every penny will make a difference:¬£1 GBP ? ?ì¬?covers the cost of a reusable protective face mask for the rangers.? ¬£5 GBP ? ?ì¬?covers the cost of fuel for one day of patrolling.¬£15 GBP ? ?ì¬?covers health insurance for one team member and their family for one month.¬£20 GBP ? ?ì¬?covers one month?ôs food costs for one ranger on the island.¬£100 GBP ? ?ì¬?covers one months reduced stipend salary for one team member.Every single donation counts. Thank you for your support!This appeal is organized by team members and friends of Chumbe island. We are collecting the money through a UK based account, before transferring it to Zanzibar. 100% of the money donated will be sent to Chumbe.

It was sold to the Adirondack Railway Corporation (mostly known for their role in operating trains to and from the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid) in 1980 and was called ""The Tampa Tiger"" due to the orange paint it arrived in. Following the shutdown of the Adirondack Railway, it was sold to the New York Susquehanna & Western as an Alco parts supply unit. The NYS&W donated the remains of the locomotive, mostly in tact to the Utica & Mohawk Valley Chapter of the NRHS in the late 1980's, and is currently on display at the Utica Children's Museum. It is important to note the locomotive was cosmetically restored and painted in the current paint scheme it is in today, but was never in service with this paint.?Unfortunately, the museum will soon be under new ownership and the locomotive must be moved. It will either be scrapped on site or it will be moved to the north side of the main railroad tracks in Utica, NY where it will be moved by rail to Remsen. The cost of the equipment to make this move is approximately $6,000 and we hope you can help us in contributing towards saving one of three remaining RSC2's. The ultimate goal is to preserve this locomotive as a static display as many of its operating components have now been used elsewhere.?Phase 1 of this project is to move the locomotive by December 15, 2020 off of the museum property and to Remsen, and Phase 2 of the project is to shift the locomotive to a location in Remsen where it can be viewed and enjoyed by anyone and everyone interested in the history of railroads in the Adirondacks.?Special thanks to the Matt Giardino and the Alco Historical & Technical Society for providing an accurate account of the locomotive history, as well as the photos and special thanks to the Utica & Mohawk Valley chapter of the NRHS, and Over the Top Construction for making this opportunity available for railroad preservation.?Photographer Unknown, appears to be leaving Utica, NY in the early 1980's.?Photo courtesy of the Matt Giardino collection",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the hike, Gottago reflected on all the kindness she received from strangers along the way. Linda wanted to pay back that kindness by paying forward to future hikers. Linda?ôs vision was to create a memento which hikers would use and cherish.Gottago contacted Cupcake and Yogi, and the team was created! Very quickly, they realized that an at-a-glance PCT mileage resource would be essential, then quickly after they realized that putting the current years??data on a bandana would be useful, handy, and a great relic to hikers: Data, Function, and Funk!The three trail friends got to work: Yogi provided the data, Cupcake created the design, and Gottago funded the bandanas. It worked! The PCT Class of 2003 got the first edition of PCT Class Bandanas: 100% cotton custom-printed bandanas which change from year to year and are gifted to thru-hikers.The bandanas quickly became a rite of passage as well as a valuable tool for PCT thru-hikers. For 16 years, from 2003 to 2018, Linda paid for all those gifted bandanas. Sixteen years is a long time for Linda to be such an amazing Trail Angel! In 2019, Linda stepped away from the bandana project to focus on her family.We (John and Jackie) couldn?ôt let Linda?ôs bandana tradition die! In 2019 we used a GoFundMe campaign to collect donations for 2019 bandanas. Our GoFundMe in 2019 paid for about 2/3 of the bandanas gifted to 2019 hikers, but it wasn?ôt enough. We personally covered the additional cost which was not funded by donations. Unfortunately, we do not have extra cash this year. We are reaching out to hikers past, present, and future to help! It?ôs simple: If everyone who received a gifted bandana in the past could donate $5, we would have more than enough to cover the costs of the 2020 bandanas. Obviously, not everyone will donate. If you are able to make a large donation, we would be forever grateful. Could you spare $25?We hope to raise enough money in 2020 to gift free bandanas to all 2020 PCT?ôers. Bandanas will be available at Triple Crown Outfitters in Kennedy Meadows (northbound 702.2, southbound 1950.4).Northbounders are already on the trail, and we cannot order the bandanas until they are paid for, so if you can donate, please do so ASAP!

1445,Lucas's Gap Year,"Created February 5, 2020",Travel & Adventure,"$6,123 ","$5,000 ",23,0,24,"Hello friends and family,As some of you know, I?ôm planning to take a gap year before I start college. I?ôve made this decision for a few reasons, but mainly because I would like to step back from school, be adventurous, and learn more about the world and about myself.?What do I plan to do between graduating from high school in June 2020 and starting at Brown in September 2021? One of my main goals is to become fluent in Spanish. I dropped Spanish a long time ago, which I regret, and now I?ôd like to rediscover the language.?First, over the summer, I will take an intensive Spanish language and culture course at Universidad Internacional Men√©ndez Pelayo (UIMP) in Santander, a small city on the north coast of Spain where I?ôll be living with a host family. Once in Europe, I?ôd also like to spend about three weeks backpacking, visiting places I?ôve never been, and traveling independently on a tight budget.In the fall, I hope to go to South America where I will study Spanish, live with host families, and either intern or volunteer for a local organization. I?ôm looking at options in Argentina (Buenos Aires), Peru (Cusco), and Ecuador (Cuenca). Apart from improving my Spanish and developing life skills, I?ôm excited about immersing myself in a part of the world where I have roots. I'm looking forward to visiting my extended family in Ecuador.?The second half of my gap year is still up in the air. One idea is to return to the U.S. and get a job with the aim of learning new skills and living independently. I realize that supporting myself on minimum wage in New York could be tough (impossible), but I?ôm open to going almost anywhere. I?ôd love any suggestions or leads.To cover the cost of my gap year, I?ôm using my savings, including the money I earned in Beijing last summer and from other odd jobs, which come to around $2,500. My parents have agreed to pay for the Spanish language program in Santander (thank you Nina, Peter, and Pablo!), and Nina is donating her frequent flier miles for airfare. Still, there?ôre a lot of remaining travel and living expenses, which is why I?ôve set up this Go Fund Me page.?I?ôm hoping that over the next year, instead of birthday or graduation or Christmas or Hanukkah gifts, you might consider contributing to my gap year. I would appreciate any contribution, whether to cover a coffee in Santander, a night at a hostel in Copenhagen, or a flight from New York to Quito. Helping me make the most of my gap year is the best gift you could give me.?Anyone who makes a contribution, no matter how small, will be invited to follow my journey on Tripcast, where I will regularly post photos. And that?ôs not all! If you contribute $25, you will receive one real, old-fashioned postcard from one of the countries I visit. If you contribute $50, you will receive postcards from three different countries I visit. If you come in at $100, you will receive a postcard from every country I visit!Thank you so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1449,Save The Samba: COVID Relief in the Galapagos,"Created June 26, 2020",Travel & Adventure,"$5,995 ","$61,740 ",28,2,28,"This is Gina Barton, CEO of Cheesemans??Ecology Safaris, writing you. CNH tours was pivotal in setting up the first GoFundMe to help raise funds for The Samba Team, and they have passed the torch on to us to continue fundraising efforts. While to date, we?ôve raised $54,008 from the first GoFundMe, this will only cover The Samba Team's basic food costs for the four months they?ôve been out of work through the end of June. We?ôd like to support them through the end of the year, but let me explain why...BackgroundWhile COVID-19 has affected businesses all over the world, tourism-related businesses may be affected for a longer period than most others. While some are fortunate enough to live and operate in wealthier countries where social assistance may be available, in low-income countries, like Ecuador, these programs do not exist.?Ecuador?ôs finances are among the worst in Latin America. In dealing with the pandemic, the Ecuadorian government does not even have enough cash to pay its civil servants, let alone provide social assistance to unemployed people.Approximately 70% of the Galapagos economy is directly or indirectly linked to tourism.?Because of COVID-19, tourism has been shut down since mid-March. While Galapagos is controlling COVID-19 fairly well (barely 100 cases ??almost half of which are the crew members of the Celebrity Flora), the population has been in a strict lock-down mode since late March.The Samba Team members are among those that face a hard several months, and that stretch will likely last through the end of the year.?While they are paid better than average salaries by the Samba owner (the ship is one of the few that has been formally recognized by the national park for its social responsibility) and the crew enjoyed generous gratuities from our travelers, they do not typically have large savings and will increasingly find themselves in a difficult situation.??Cheesemans??Relationship with The Samba TeamSince 2012, Cheesemans??Ecology Safaris has led 15 in-depth, two-week trips on the Samba to experience the best of the Galapagos with Juan and his team, so approximately 210 people have joined Cheesemans' in the Galapagos. Since 2015, CNH Tours has helped approximately 1,100 people enjoy a wonderful Active Galapagos trip on the Samba. We are coordinating efforts with each other in hopes that we can take care of the basic needs of the families of The Samba Team who rely on these trips to make a livelihood. Thank you to those alumni who have already donated!Fund-raising objectiveThis amount would provide basic food for 20 families, who work directly or indirectly with The Samba Team, through the end of this year, all of whom are currently out of work, plus cover the transaction fees that GoFundMe charges (2.9% plus $0.30 per donation). A reasonable amount to cover the basic food costs for a family of four is $500 per month. Staples typically consist of rice, plantain, beans, onions, potatoes, fresh vegetables and fruit, fish, chicken, cooking oil, flour, and sugar.Distributing FundsWe will distribute these funds evenly among the 20 families regardless if we meet our objective. Funds will be transferred directly from Cheesemans??Ecology Safaris to the Samba owners, who we?ôve had a close relationship with since 2012, who will distribute it evenly among the 20 families. The Samba owners will not keep any of these funds.Comments from our TravelersThe Samba Team consistently receives glowing reviews from the trips we?ôve shared with them.?úJuan and his crew went above and beyond to ensure that every individual was treated well. I don't believe I have ever seen a similar level of attention for clients as they provided.??David L. Sparks, 2016? ?úJuan Manuel Salcedo and crew are top notch. Juan is a terrific leader - great breadth and depth of knowledge, and seems to effortlessly manage his crew and his clients. Always had us at the right place at the right time (for light, animal activity, etc).??Karen Perry, 2019?úI looked forward to each day and had total confidence that Juan and the crew were going to do everything they could to make the experience educational, enjoyable and safe. I felt that they shared in our excitement as we explored and learned about the Galapagos.??LuAnn Ewan, 2017Thank you for your consideration!We know many people are in need, but this is one effort we can stand behind confidently; that it is going straight to folks in need, and that supports the Samba owners in providing socially responsible tourism for many years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, Rangers need to be equipped with field uniforms and gear, much of which must be replaced on an annual basis given the demands of the environment and the frequency of use. This gear includes boots, socks, trousers, shirts, hats, backpacks, headlamps, water bottles, jackets, bedrolls, tents, binoculars, and GPS devices.June through September typically sees the most tourists in Namibia, however, COVID??9 has abruptly cut off this critical means of support. While we are happy to report that ranger salaries have been secured for another year, they will unfortunately not have funding for gear renewal until late 2021 at the earliest, which means some rangers will be wearing the same boots for two full years, covering 25 km a day in them.Wilderness Travel and our partners on the ground are organizing emergency financial relief to the amazing team of Namibian Rhino and Lion Rangers, some of whom you met on your trip with us. We are hoping you will consider assisting us in making sure these rangers have the gear they need to continue their critical work. Our goal is to raise $5,500 USD in support of a team of about 70 people.WT is not an NGO, nor do we have a non-profit arm, so these donations will not be tax-deductible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been asked again and again what lead me and could possibly have motivated me to want to compete in the Golden Globe 2022. My answer is simple: it inspired me in 2018/2019, to watch people push themselves to the maximum of their potential in sport, endurance, seamanship, resourcefulness, tenacity and much more! It inspired me to try to make this challenge my own. Without a doubt, this is my cup of tea!Most humans are inspired by great feats in sports, science, exploration, adventure, arts etc. - because it shows us what we are capable of as humans - not only as individuals, but collectively. Over the centuries, individual humans have achieved great things - but undoubtedly, WITH the support of other individuals who backed them up on many levels.Already, on these first steps into my journey towards the start-line of the Golden Globe 2022, I have had great support in encouragement, ideas, skill, contacts, resources and knowledge from friends and strangers alike; old friendships have been rekindled, new friendships have been formed, and ultimately, this is a team-effort and ?úan example of friendship??, from the word ?úGO???I have secured a boat to race in the GGR 2022. Those who have already owned a boat will know that it is like a black hole that sucks up funds. Preparing for a race like the Golden Globe takes extraordinary and meticulous preparation as the majority of the sailing takes place in the Southern Ocean, some of the stormiest stretches of ocean on the planet,?Phase 1: I start off with the goal to raise USD 100,000. ?This will go towards:?- Debts on the initial purchase of the boat: USD 60 000-? Running costs, such as mooring: 1500 USD per annum-Insurance on the vessel: USD 1000 per annum-? Doing basic work on the boat to get it ready for a move, away from the icy realms of Newfoundland in winter, down to a yard in more temperate climate (where I can devote many months of my labour and funds towards the refit): includes stepping the mast again, comprehensive engine service, cleaning out of fuel tanks, servicing electric wiring, servicing of all through-hull fittings, servicing of expired safety equipment, such as fire-extinguishers, bilge pumps etc., new flares, launching the boat and a whole lot more??: USD 15,000??Phase 2 -? Extensive refit to the boat.Some of the considerations for making my vessel sea-worthy for a race of approximately 30,000 nautical miles over a duration of 7 - 9 months or more, in some of the roughest oceans, non-stop, solo, without outside assistance:?-? replacement of entire rig (spars, standing, stainless rigging, running rigging, chain-plates, spinnaker poles, roller-? furlers, additional reinforcement, as well as shipping of parts, labour, travel-lift/crane fees: 30,000 USD +-? water-tight bulkhead and companionway hatch: 15,000 USD +- replacement of worn components like bob-stay attachments, bowsprit, rudder shaft, bolts, pintels, gudgeons and restorative work on bulwarks, decks etc.: USD 20,000 +-? replacement of all wiring, plumbing, skin-fittings, batteries, solar panels etc. USD 15,000-? suitable wind-vane plus spare: USD 15,000 - installation of HF and VHF comms: USD 4,000 -? ?and more??(like compulsory equipment, sails, tools for effectuating repairs at sea etc., (to list but a few at this stage))-? Complete new compliment of racing and storm sails: USD 20,000?Phase 3-? Preparing for the race: ?-? completing requirements, such as the 2000nm qualifier-? sailing the boat under jury rig as well as sailing the boat with a make-shift rudder and documenting this all with high-quality video footage-? training hard to master speed, as well as storm tactics -? ?other considerations such as compulsory racing entry fees (16,000 AUD), compulsory racing equipment, (includes emergency grab-bag with SAT-phone, GPS etc. - to remain sealed unless in a life-threatening situation)-? flights and accommodation to attend compulsory meetings-? food provisions to sustain oneself for up to a year or more at sea-? appropriate foul-weather gear-? Heavy weather and storm sailing equipment such as drogues, sea-anchors etc.-? navigational charts and other navigational publications and equipment-? and a whole lot more?¶¬†These are but a few examples! The list goes on and on?¶The help of donations from anyone who is interested in watching the evolution of this endeavour, will go a long way towards my advancing towards the start-line of the Golden Globe Race in September 2022 - I cannot possibly get there on my own! Your support will be of paramount importance. This is, after all, a team-effort!As part of my team, Dr. Mark Lindborg will be managing the donation funds raised through GOFundMe. Mark is a?

They realize that there are much more important places to donate money to such as the health care workers, but at the end of the day, they do need our help.My name is Vincent Posterli, and I?ôve had the great fortune to travel to Grand Cayman almost every summer since I was born. When I was ten years old I received my Junior Open Water certification from Nick Buckley (one of the owners of the LPDC) and I dreamed of working in Grand Cayman as a Divemaster. Luckily for me,? life came full circle.? I reached out to the crew and there was an opening. I was fortunate enough to do my Divemaster course with the Lobster Pot and for five short months, I was able to call myself part of the crew, made memories of a lifetime, and most importantly, I made friends who made me feel at home.??During this worldwide pandemic, they are facing an unprecedented challenge. Grand Cayman has effectively closed with the government stating that tourism is unlikely to start up again until 2021. While the airports stay shut, many small businesses are unfortunately having to close their doors. Everyone in the dive industry saw their business disappear overnight. The Lobster Pot Dive Center is a well-run operation;however like all small businesses, they could not have conceived nor planned for the outbreak of COVID-19. We want to make sure that they will not have to close their doors forever.?I am certain that everyone who has spent time in this dive center has had an experience to remember, and we want to make sure that they will still be there for us when we are able to return! We can?ôt wait to see Mike and Peg at the front desk to greet us as we walk through the door, and jumping on the boat to hear more of Captain Steve?ôs stories, or learning something new from their excellent instructors Charlotte, John and Charlie.?The Lobster Pot Dive Center is not only the home for the Lobster Pot crew, but it's also a hub for a number of Cayman?ôs premier dive operations ??Deep Blue Divers, Wall To Wall Diving, and Off The Wall Divers. They are a family and make us feel like part of the family with every visit.??The crew has promise that 100% of your donations will go to The Lobster Pot Dive Center Corporate Bank Account and will be used towards staff payroll and health insurance, necessary boat and operating expenses and getting the crew members that had to leave back home to Cayman once operations resume. The fund will also cover any work permit renewals that need to be made. Any money donated that is not used will be donated to good causes.?Once all of this mess is over and the world returns to normal, I hope that you will call the dive center up and book a course or get on the dive boat. At the same time, the parents of another 10 year old child may do the same thing. Your donations will allow this crew to inspire many more generations of divers ??and one day those children will grow up to become dive professionals just like I did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is one of the Hardest physical tasks I have gone through in this lifetime. I would like to complete my healing after the chemo and radiation to make sure that I remain in good health. I?ôm not sure what that?ôs going to look like. I suspect it?ôs going to be a year of rebuilding my body and cleansing my kidneys liver and spleen of all the treatments I?ôve been putting in there. In addition when I arrived on Maui I was in a bit of a rush to buy a car and made the mistake of buying something without having a mechanic go over it. It?ôs cost me $4000. Currently I am not able to drive and so I don?ôt have a vehicle. In February I?ôll be looking to purchase something inexpensive and reliable if it makes sense for me. That?ôs when my mainland caregivers/family will be going back to their regular lives. So this time I?ôm setting a goal of $20,000, Which to be clear will not be used towards a vehicle. All of this money will be used for healing my physical body.Every little bit helps! I am in a good place. Have all the support and advice I currently need. Prayers that envision me as healthy and wiser are so welcome. I?ôll cycle that love right back at you after is moves through my healed body.Please check out my videos in the first campaign and I?ôll be posting up dates here as well.Blessings and gratitude Timothy ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is one of the best Veterinary Nurses I know. She puts her heart and soul into caring for every single patient she has.

A generic 2 to 5 year life expectancy is given (I didn't ask for me specifically) I had grade 3 Breast Cancer in 2015.Mastectomy, reconstruction, chemo, radiotherapy, further reconstruction. Hormone therapy. March 2019 - Grade 4 diagnosis - spread to vertebrae L4 body and spinous process of L5 +Mediastinal lymph nodes.More Radiotherapy.Ovaries irradiatedMore hormone treatment.Spread to rib 7, skull, femurs, still in same vertebrae. More radiotherapy, chemo and hormone treatment?My right femur is full of cancer, not just a little - It is also in my left femur but not painful yet. I will be receiving a high dose of radiotherapy to my right femur - this should reduce pain, make me able to walk again, strengthen my bone and hopefully reduce the tumour.The reality.No one knows how long they have. I'm just more aware.I have to believe I have more than 5 years... And I will fight for many more.Some people think I am negative with saying this, I'm not! I am being realistic and I'm not necessarily sad about it... Of course I don't want to die, but we all will at some point, so at least I have time to accept it, right? I am still hopeful there will continue to be new trials new treatments to keep me going. I post a lot about cancer and my diagnosis... I never wanted this to be what defines me, however for the past 5.5 years it has been a massive part of my life - so it is here, it is part of who I am now, and it hasn't all been bad!I have grown massively as a person.It has forced me to work on my mental health (something we all need to do more of) and actually improved it and I hope I can pass that on.... There is always work to be done on this. My low days may be reallllllly low.My high days are really high - because when I feel good It is soooo appreciated!I would say I have a healthy 90:10 ratio good : bad. (maybe don't ask me this on a bad day) It has improved my ability as a Veterinary nurse from personal experiences and I love my job. My nurses got me through all of this rubbish and if I can help an animal along the way I will do my absolute best.It has brought so many amazing people in to my life and highlighted the good ones I already had. They are truly amazing and I am so lucky.I appreciate everything.I am grateful for what I have.I am in a lot of pain now, and the next 2 months will be hard (because I am stubborn and want to get up and run!) but this will help and I cannot wait to ba back to normal, back to work (I miss the patients ) back to running, yoga, gym, travelling, long treks with Kobi... Maybe I should get back to walking first...but I will...

Erin and I are acting as mentors for this trip and are so excited we?ôve been asked to lead this group. Thanks to Logos Wilderness Therapy, this group of women will be spending a few days in the backcountry of Wyoming for an experience of healing, encouragement, and community. Almost all the expenses of the backcountry trip will be covered by Logos Wilderness Therapy but we need your help to cover the remaining cost. We are raising $6,500 to cover the cost of six plane tickets, a few days in an Airbnb to adjust to the altitude before being in the backcountry, and gear for the wilderness trip. During the few days before the backcountry trip. Our group will engage in team-building activities, survivor leaders from the surrounding community will come to share their experiences of success and achievement. We want to make this a life-changing and unforgettable trip for these women. We want them to come out of this knowing how much they are loved and cared for by the community, to know that there is a world of possibility for them, and most importantly that they feel the power of their inner strength and internal resources. Because most of these women have never been on a plane, have never experienced high altitudes, and have never gone across the country to spend a few days off-grid with people who are practically strangers, Erin and I want to help these women navigate these new experiences and help them be psychically and emotionally prepared for the trip. We have already been engaging with the group in training activities, and collectively these survivors have walked over 60 miles over bridges of Jacksonville to prepare for incline. We have some nature hikes planned and another trip in the works to expose the women to rock scrambling. These women are just as dedicated as Erin and I, if not more, in making the most out of this trip. We know this will be an experience that will help these survivors stretch out into the growth zone, find new confidence in themselves, bring healing in their hearts, and develop a new sense of community with one another. We hope you will consider being a part of this experience of renewal and hope for these amazing survivors of trafficking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1472,My last chance,"Created July 7, 2020","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","??3,000 ",0,0,0,0,"People thought interior design is all about decorations, even some TV shows promoted it that way, but in my opinion, interior design is the scale that is closest to the human life.? I see the potential of exploring the human behaviours, experiments the way we live, the psychology aspect of design, and the chance of creating a way of living that we never thought of, to make our life and society better.Hello, my name is Haley Chen, I'm from the little beautiful island in Asia, named Taiwan. I am now working and try to fullfill my dream - to study abroad in the major of interior design in the top art school in the world and hoping the make this world a better place in the future. This dream have been in my mind since i was in secondary school (junior high), after 12 years, I finally have a chance to make it come true.I am blessed to get an offer from Glasgow School of Art last year, which is one of the top 10 ranking art schools in the world, however, I postponed it and now working in a company that does not pay the overtime wage (this is very common here, but wrong),? because last year when I was all prepared to start my journey in the UK, my mum got into an serious car accident on free way that cost all the money we saved for my master, but you know, my mum's life is more important than anything else in the whole universe to me.You might wonder why i cant just work for a few years first and try to save that money back, which i am actually doing right now, but in Taiwan, design jobs has the lowest average salary of all jobs (this is not said by me but the government data), no matter how good you are in this job, your wage just wont go higher than 1,600 USD per moth, well at least it is NOT a common case, especially if you are just graduated from university, so it is basically impossible for me to just work first and save money, because in reality, my salary is just 833 USD per month. (Even the senior designer in the company earn below 1,600 per month, how sad haha)But i am still thankful that i am able to get this job. I planned to study abroad which means I might quit in the future, and the employer still willing to hire me (because of my experience and the international awards i won). Even tho he doesn't pay for the overtime working, but?i have learnt so much that i feel prepared to really start my master degree,so I am here to ask for your help.The master course starts in September this year, yet I still cant manage to cover the tuition fee, the accommodation fee and living. In Taiwan, we only need around 1,700 USD per semester, however in UK, especially top schools in the world, international students need to pay nearly 20,000 pounds (around 26,666USD) for JUST tuition fee, and I am really in the urgent of your help since the time is ticking...?I would appreciate anything you can contribute. But if you are not able to donate, I will still be super appreciate if you can share the link to everyone you can think of. And I promise if one day I have to ability to earn this money back by my own, I will donate the same amount or more to the society who needs help just like I do right now.My mum made who i am today, and i am now trying to go on this road, to my dream, on my own.Thank you for your help.--------------------------------------More about why i am not taking money from my mum? if you want to know:Well first of all, she (in the photo) doesn't have that money.Second of all, I know it sounds a little a bit clich√©, but i come from a single parent family, and live with my mother and my brother since i was in the age of 12. My mother tried so hard to raise me and my brother up, that she gave up all her dreams, just to give us the best education we can get at that time, while my father just chose to stay in his family(his brothers and parents) instead of taking care of us.She opened a little shop to make the living for us, staying there from 9am to 10pm everyday, every year, while my dad cheating on my mum with my mum's sister, telling us he doesn't want us in our face at the divorce court, and making all my mum's family members turned their back on her. But my mum never gave up, and has been so supportive through out whole time, and she wants to support the fee for my master degree by working days and nights in bad body condition, which i can not accept at all.This is why I can not let my mum have any feeling that she must? pay for this because she mustn't, I feel like I have owed her so much that I even feel guilty about taking her money. I really cant even express how thankful I am for what she has done for me.--------------------------------------",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been on my mind since the death of my beloved grandfather in 2007. After thirteen years of wishing, I have the chance to make it come true.My grandparents were named Arthur and Annie Stone, and they were the children of sharecroppers. They too were sharecroppers until the 1960s, when they were able to purchase their farm outright. They raised three daughters there, including my mama.?When Papa died, Nanny could not run the farm on her own, and my mom and her sisters made the choice to sell it. I was 17 at the time, and the longing for that farmhouse with the dark green shutters has stayed on my shoulders all these years since.?Simply put: I am going to try to buy it back. Miraculously, the current owner is looking to sell it.This is the one chance I?ôll ever have to do this.For me, the story begins in 1995, the first of countless times I remember piling in the car with my siblings and parents, driving the three and a half hours from Atlanta, GA, to Nanny and Papa?ôs house in Petersburg, TN. This farmhouse was where we spent countless happy Thanksgivings, Christmases, and summer holidays.But for Arthur and Annie stone, the story starts 150 years before that. To the period just after the American Civil War called Reconstruction.?Quick history lesson if you need one: Agriculture was the economic force of the Southern United States, and the enslavement of people descended from stolen Africans kept the economy afloat. After the enslaved became freedmen, General Sherman proposed that the land seized from former Confederates should be divided among the freedmen, as repayment for their treatment.?This is commonly referred to as Forty Acres and a Mule, and it was a promise that wasn?ôt kept. Instead, the land was returned to the former Confederates who previously owned it.?The land needed to be worked. And there was an entire population -- only recently considered citizens in their own right -- who needed work and food and security. Enter: sharecropping.?Sharecropping was an exploitative model. It worked like this: a tenant would live on and work a portion of a landowner?ôs plantation, farm, or land. In exchange, that tenant kept a (usually small) portion of the crop come harvest time.?Sharecroppers had very little agency. They didn?ôt own their own equipment, they were forced to accept the prices the landowners were willing to pay, and if they stuck up for themselves they risked their livelihood and family home.?In the last years of her life, Nanny told me that she had taken to being pen pals with the son of the landowner she sharecropped for. He apologized for the ways he and his family had wronged my grandparents. It is no small feat that these people -- my people -- born not even 60 years after the dissolution of slavery, broke the mold of their families and somehow overcame admitted wrongdoing. That feels like another miracle.?If all I ever accomplished in my life was buying back my grandparents??farm and restoring it to something they would be proud of, that would be enough. I want to live a life where my siblings and our children can go back there for holidays. I want my mama to spend more Thanksgivings or Christmases there in her life.?So I am asking you to please help me get my ancestral home back. I would appreciate anything you can contribute. And if you are not in a position to donate, all I ask is that you share the link to this campaign with everyone you can think of.?Nanny and Papa spent their entire lives in the picturesque state of Tennessee; living through the roaring twenties, the great depression, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement, and so much more.?Their lives make up the history of that land.

We must move swiftly to obtain the necessary funds and return this land to the Black family who have stewarded it for generations.Please write the organizers for more detailed info on sending large donations via wire transfer <3---Update from Carlin on July 4 + photos of the land:The outpouring of support has been so great I am beside myself. In less than 24 hours we are almost halfway to our goal to reacquire this land. For all who have given and for all who are considering, we say thank you from the bottom of hearts for being willing to support our freedom dreams. My family and I are blown away. With your support I hope to place an offer on the property in the next 72 hours.We are looking forward to creating a safe space for our people (TGNC, Queer, BIPOC organizers, artists, teachers, healers and those who might just need to get loved on for a while) to come rest, dream, and strategize. We are trusting and believing that this is possible. We are trusting and believing that we will be able to pour even more love back into this home that has held us. Stewardship and love was my grandparents??vision for this land and that is my goal. ---Carlin's words:There is a patch of land in North Carolina where freedom grows. The seeds were planted by my grandfather's hands over 70 years ago and have been nurtured by my family each generation since.?As a child I would look out and over what he had held for us for so long and picture the unspeakable acts of terror bestowed upon the land by white men washed away by the unimaginable strength and goodness and love that my family soaked back into the earth year after year.?In this time many of us find ourselves wondering what it means to find home, to fight for freedom and to hold onto it by any means necessary. This moment holds more truth and possibility and bitterness than we could have ever collectively imagined. This moment also holds within it a possibility for a return to the land.?There is a house, a tired and seen many-a-thing house that sits on the land my grandfather planted those freedom seeds on. It was removed from my family's possession 48 years ago, and today - it is for sale.?It is no small thing to be called to a place. It is a larger thing still to let myself hope that there is a possibility of return. As a Black Queer southern organizer, fighting for the freedom of my people is my birthright. I am seeking a reclamation of what it means to be free and am reaching out to you for support in realizing it.?We have a limited amount of time to raise the money required to bring the house and the land home again. I am humbly asking for those who feel called, to give what you are able. In making this request of my community I am fighting against losing hope.?Any and everything would be a blessing.?In the greatest love,?Carlin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Steven suffered a severe spinal cord injury in his c6/c7 vertebrae. Steven was transported to Waterford University Hospital where they realised how serious his injuries were and then from Waterford he got a garda escort by Ambulance to The Spinal Injuries Unit in the Mater Hospital in Dublin. The gifted and what can only be described as Angels of a medical team operated on him the following day and he spent 12 hours in surgery, they told us it was the worst spinal injury that they have ever seen and that he was lucky he wasn't killed on impact.This injury has left him at 24 years of age as a Quadriplegic which also brings with this type of injury a lot more medical conditions such as Dysreflexia,no bladder or bowel control and his chest is very weak which leaves him very high risk to infections. He will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Steven has never stopped fighting for his life, overcoming obstacles and continuing to prove his strength everyday. His rehabilitation journey was long and hard and with the help of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dublin he is now ready to return home but it is with a great financial cost to do so.Steven will require specialist equipment, and specialised care and support for a long time and most likely forever. Steven is currently in a wonderful caring Nursing Home in Clarinbridge Co. Galway as the family are working hard to get him home. The cost to get him home is tens of thousands as the home needs to be completely adapted to his needs and this does not include purchasing a wheelchair adapted van for him. We are trying to raise funds to ease the financial burden on his family. So Saturday the 18th of July I and some of Stevens family members undertook a challenge to walk from Roscrea Co. Tipperary to the top of Devils Bit in Templemore Co. Tipperary and back to Roscrea a total of 52km while pushing a wheelchair right to the top of The Devils Bit. Steven also a did the 52k on the same day on his Rowing Machine for his arms in the nursing home that day.We have kept this go fund me open because we are pushing to get Simmo home to all of us and we need all the help we can get. Steven has spoke about his experience on the Ryan Tubridy Show Tuesday 11th August and we are so happy that people got to know Steven like we do, Positive, Caring and Loving.If anyone can donate to this I would be truly grateful no matter how big or small.

1483,"A Prisoner In His Own Home, Help Free Charles","Created April 22, 2020","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","$78,079 ","$250,00",541,4.7K,545,"In 2014, Charles Lamar Blackwell was 3 years out of high school, having graduated in 2011 from Central High School on Detroit's west side. Charles aspired to becoming a Detroit Police Officer but before he actively pursued that career path, he decided to first give back so joined Michigan's Army National Guard in March of 2014. He signed up, took his oath, and was waiting to ship off to boot camp.On June 1 st, 2014 Charles??life changed. He was gunned down in a drive-by shooting while visiting his cousin a block away from Central High School. As a result, Charles was paralyzed from the waist down. And on that day, a young man with big dreams of serving others pretty much lost his freedom.Charles didn?ôt give up, though.? He was learning to live his life as a paraplegic and was being cared for by his mother, Carolyn Young. On the night of April 1 st, 2016, Carolyn Young was killed in a hit-and-run traffic collision; a speeding Dodge Challenger slammed into her Nissan Altima, pinning her inside and ultimately killing her not far from the family home she shared with her husband, daughter Brandy, and son Charles. I remember that night well; Charles and I were already friends.The Day Charles Mother, Carolyn Young,? Was Killed?April Fool?ôs day, 2016 is the day life drastically changed for Charles.? With his mother and primary care giver gone, there was no one able to lift and carry Charles down the stairs of their rented flat, a home they had been in for many years, long before Charles was shot. Charles??father, with medical conditions stemming from diabetes, simply isn't able to help.?As a result, Charles became trapped in a 2nd floor flat, unable to leave unless the State of Michigan and Medicaid deemed it essential. Ambulance costs with lift assist down a flight of stairs can and often cost over $2,600 dollars per round trip. Medicaid does approve visits to an emergency room in an emergency, but for visits to a dentist, routine doctor?ôs office visits, etc., that cost is often left up to Charles. Charles monthly income?? $968.00 a month.Finding Section 8 housing in Detroit is extremely difficult; the wait times are often over 5 years. An attempt was made to find new housing, but there wasn't much help available and Charles??needs went unanswered and to this day they continue to go unanswered.Undeterred, Charles spent the next 4 years pursuing an education; an education online because he can't leave the second-floor flat. Charles has graduated twice in 4 years; once with an associate of arts degree in general business, and again with an associate of arts degree in business IT. He was just accepted to another online school, Northwood University, to pursue a bachelor?ôs degree in business. Charles is determined.So, you ask, why am I starting this GoFundMe account for Charles? Well, I want Charles to be free. See, we often take life for granted, you and me. We're able to go to the store, movies, restaurants, parties or just visit our backyards to enjoy a sunny afternoon or cool evening.?Charles can't. Not that Charles doesn't want to, but he can't. He's trapped in a 2nd floor flat, in a tough part of Detroit, with the same view, day in and day out. He can't tell if it's sunny outside unless he looks out the window. He's a prisoner in his own home and has been a prisoner for 4 years.We're looking to provide Charles a safe, accessible, and comfortable home. Charles sister, Brandy, received a scholarship to Michigan State University through hard work and determination; she's soon to graduate and we're looking to give her a place to visit her family, to enjoy a cool evening with Charles in the backyard. We're looking to remove the obstacles life has placed in Charles path; obstacles that prevent him from enjoying even the most simple things:? the ability to seek medical help without going bankrupt, the ability to take his education and make something of his incredible life, to work and take care of himself. We're looking to right the wrongs society has done to Charles. This 26-year-old man from Detroit has experienced the worst life has to offer. I'd like you to look back in your own life and remember the times someone helped you. That help may have been a small gesture or a big gesture, but it made a difference in your life. I certainly can remember such times in mine.Your gesture of generosity will help us in achieving our goal. It may be small, it may be large, but a gesture is a gesture. After all, the only thing we leave behind in life is our good deeds.Thank you,John RobertsVideo of Charles Blackwell being interviewed by WXYZ Channel 7 Reporter Jennifer Ann Wilson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gyanchand (Gyan, Gyani) passed away after an excruciating but very brave two year battle with cancer. He lived an exemplary life by guiding peers and juniors in many ways. He also cared deeply for people in need, both within and outside his circle of acquaintances. Gyan was close to so many of us and his memories will be cherished forever.?Gyan is survived by his wife Rachana and 2 kids, Vibha (9 years) and Laksh (5 years). Currently, Rachana and kids have emotional support of family, friends and Gyanchand's colleagues. However, Rachana has been a housewife throughout. We strongly felt that financial help is necessary to deal with the loss. In memory of Gyan and with his family's approval, we have created this GoFundMe page. All proceeds will go directly to Rachana to help them in the near future and in times to come.?Please continue to keep Mehta family in your prayers.Case for financial help:?While Gyan had health coverage through the employer, Gyan had mentioned that family has substantial out-of-pocket expenses that is yet to be paid. Gyan did not want any help towards paying those bills. As Rachana has been a house-wife so far, we feel that the money raised will be needed to support the family, especially kids' education.?More about Gyanchand's battle with cancer:?Gyanchand was diagnosed with Myeloid Dysplasia in April of 2018. The alarmingly low RBC, platelet, and WBC counts meant that he was in grave danger and needed multiple blood transfusions every week. He underwent harsh chemotherapy regimen for many months while managing medical complications such as high blood pressure, fistula and appendicitis. To deal with the pain and emotional toll, he sought the refuge of books, meditation, pranayama (breathing control) and conversations with friends. He underwent what looked to be successful bone marrow transplant in February 2019. The bone marrow biopsy results also meant that he was 'cancer-free' for practical purposes. The donor cells were also producing blood cells in a satisfactory manner. However, he started suffering from multi-organ GVHD which ultimately became debilitating. Clinical management of GVHD became quite challenging with viral flares and other complications. Even with all these, Gyan managed to find new clients in his consultancy role and always looked forward to work. Finally, with fungal sinusitis and pneumonia, doctors felt that only miracles could save him. Gyan refused ICU care and wanted to improve his condition sheerly by his Will Power. He spent his last days contacting many friends and being with his close family and friends. His body finally succumbed with a rupture in the lungs.?More about Gyanchand:?Gyanchand was a fun living and easy-going person. He sought and nurtured friendships. He took a lot of satisfaction from guiding acquaintances in matters of his expertise. His humanity knew no bounds. He was especially passionate about financial matters: financial literacy, financial freedom, financial prudence etc. He was a voracious reader, always on the look out for emerging trends of the world.??Originally from India, Gyan held a high regard for entrepreneurial, industrious, and innovative work culture prevalent in the USA. Similarly, he was in awe of elite universities of the land. He was very keen to ensure that his kids get the best higher education that they can possibly get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He harbored the desire to build a non-profit educational fund to support young designers in their career journey.We are establishing this fund to make some of his incomplete aspirations come true. The proceeds from the fund will be split between initiatives that support educational initiatives in the UX community and college savings for his kids, Aarav, and Aanya.

Molly was a source of light and joy in so many lives in Austin and in her native Hawaii.

Thank you for taking your precious time to read this, it means a lot to me and my family.And thank you if you decide to support us with this huge project, even sharing this campaign is a lot, as it'll reach more people who may want to help.Pictures of the Roof and other damages.Roof was red originally.2 inch nail to hold the ladder in place pulled out by the weight of snow.Shingle ripped off but glued back.Holes and rust on roof drains.Wood bricks placed to help water flow the right way.Could probably drain some spaghetti water using this corner.Mold in the bathroom around the ventilation, suffering a lot of water dripping during winter as heat rises to the roof top, melting the snow, causing water to flow in.Other damages, I am surprised the porch is still standing, despite the rotten material, it's very dangerous to walk on it as everybody have to walk very carefully.Okay enough about these horrific pictures, here's a very beautiful one to show that there is something positive about this place.Here's a picture of our oldest cat, Leo, in the beautiful summer sunrise.And sunset, had to turn the video into gif format, not sure if it's working.HD picture of the gif.Anyways, I wont take more of your time, but I want to thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart, to take the time to read this campaign and hopefully show generosity by either sharing or donating, as it really means a lot to me and my family.Sincerely,Leto",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chess saved me from the dark places when I was growing up, and it?ôs always been a dream of mine to just show others how focusing on a checkerboard can do so much to help ease the mind. More than just a game, I also use chess as a catalyst to help teach youth in the neighboring Ardmore community at Haverford.

For those who don?ôt know, our beloved friend Stafford Wulff has been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Stafford is endeavouring to take this all in his stride and is aiming to complete his internship with SAAS despite this adversity. Through working at Parkside together, we have realised that Stafford has obviously got some huge stressors - a big one being his selfless aim to ensure his wife is secure following his passing. Due to the combined effects of chemotherapy and illness, there is a chance Stafford may not be able to complete his internship as he planned. Given his enormous heart, drive and generosity to those around him, we think it would be a great idea to assist in lessening some of the stress that this incredible man is facing. If you are able to do so, we are asking you to donate as little or as much as you can to help support Stafford and his wife, Kirsty. If possible, we would appreciate if this link was not shared publicly but instead privately with your friends/family/colleagues until we show Stafford at a later date.

At only 40 years old, Arlie has fought a long hard battle with breast cancer.?Being diagnosed in October of 2018 with breast cancer, Arlie won the fight in December of 2019. After bravely and strongly going through chemo, surgery and radiation her breast cancer fight was won. Now, with less than 5 months of cancer free celebration and a reasonable sense of normalcy, Arlie has now been diagnosed with an aggressive terminal brain cancer. This diagnosis on Tuesday May 12th 2020 has devastated her, her husband and child of only the tender age of 7. This brain cancer can not be cured. The initial treatment plan was immediate surgery then radiation to follow. Unfortunately further testing showed surgery was not an option. Radiation would be the only treatment that would slow the cancer, thus giving Arlie 6 months to 1.5 years. A week ago before radiation was to happen, Arlie suffered seizures that sent her to the hospital. This disease has shown how terrible it can be. For those who love and care, know or not know Arlie and her loving little family any help would be appreciated.This page is being set up in hopes of raising money for Arlie, her fianc√© Scott and their beautiful daughter McKinley.?The family is praying for nothing but a positive outcome and any donation is greatly appreciated.?We all know Arlie is the most beautiful, positive and caring person and we know that she will keep on fighting.

But this is where we need farms. This is where we need black educators, where we need representation, where we need support.?As a permaculturaist, urban farmer, and educator I want to create a space that is accessible for folks. A haven that I would have wanted in my agriculture journey.?I want to share my food growing experience with BIPOC. All of my experience has been on white owned farms that I didn't own and didn't walk away from with anything more than experience, callouses, and a dream to start my own farm. I want to create a system that better feeds us, brings us joy, provides us with jobs, and in turn heals the land that our ancestors stewarded.?I'm so thankful for your support. Whether its just reading this and understanding. Or sharing with your friends and family. Or donating 5 dollars or donating 5 thousand dollars, I'm so thankful that I feel supported enough by you all to even begin this journey.I can't wait to post updates when we have reached goals to:1) Secure Land with water access2) Secure Farm Startup Infrastructure (1-2 hoop houses, irrigation, wash stations)3) Startup EquipmentI was born with hands stained crimson. The coagulated blood of the black women who came before me pulses through my veins. It is their calluses I can feel pushing through the tender surface of each aching palm; a young corn stalk fighting to witness the waning light.?As the evening sun settles in sheets of solid grey I can hear the nay saying whisper ?úhoney do not work the soil?îthis is not your land??and I do not take heed. The coming night forces elongated shadows into the city scape and the silhouettes of my tomato plants appear minacious, sinister, forboding and I do not mind. Sealed against a Los Angeles night sky I kick my worn boots against the compost bin door, loosening the compacted soil and frightening the flighty pigeons who come to the garden for corn and camaraderie.??úOur family farmed until we didn?ôt have to anymore. And then we were free to live ??my great uncle once told me, gathered around a Thanksgiving table. ?úwhy would you want to go back to that???he questioned. Helping himself to another ear of corn.If I pull up the weeds ,will I pull away the curtains of the past? Turning the soil and turning back the hands of time; each shovel full of dirt unearthing the still warm, still beating heart of a black woman.My grandmothers mother saying ?úyou don't have to do this anymore.??What if I plant a seed? Will it grow not from the surface but from somewhere else, deep within the earth where our ancestors, unappeased, still dwell?I once met a young man of color at an earth skills gathering. We found solace in each others company and had no trouble falling into the deep conversations that I usually reserve for childhood friends. He told me he owned a farm thirty minutes from the rocky soils where I grew up. His farm is a cattle and produce farm and he told me that he regularly took in young black kids as apprentices. I expected him to speak of them with high regard, excitement for a future of farming people of color, envisioning a revolution in which our children take back the land. Instead, he disparaged them. He told me that they were ?úmostly useless??and that they were not concerned with how things grow or why we should want them to. He did not respect them. He did not see them as they are; young shoots of bamboo with delicate leaves and malleable stalks waiting for the moment that they might shoot toward the sky in lustered resilience. He failed to buoy their creativity and, in return, they did not flourish.?When I was 20 I was a back-to the- lander. Folks would often ask me why I want to live without running water, to cook on a wood stove, and baptize myself in the occasional flowing stream in lieu of a hot shower? The answer then and now has always been simple: Because there are two wars being fought within the Black community?îone is a war on health wherein we cannot access the foods that will nourish our being. The other is a war on our education wherein we cannot find the mentors to lend a hand of inclusivity. Many of the children of color that I work with feel the need to elevate their status. To show the world they are not ?òworthless??despite what others have been lead to believe. Unfortunately, symbols of status and farming seem to be mutually exclusive. Living a life of resourcefulness wherein you do not depend on the capitalist regime is not favored. Farming becomes less and less important. Their fields lie fallow.The lessons that I have learned from the nights that I spend with my great, great grandmother, when she whispers to me through the white pines and tulip poplars bathed in the luminescence of a blood moon are lessons of resilience. Her voice comes to me like a waking dream, each word sturdy like a promise deep within my being where love takes root and understanding blooms. There is a place within the soul that fears that history will fold in on itself like the old accordion style road maps, each route colliding and melding into one confused loop. We are afraid that in climbing the ladder we might fall and land further down than we began. I want to silence this fear.?I want to hold my grandmothers mothers hand, and together walking through my gardens I will? tell her, ??We made this. This land is ours??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From national broadcasts? to obituaries across the northern hemisphere his contributions to music as a founder, key voice and songwriter in The Stems? is justly celebrated. The music never stopped, because Richard was a dynamo and a genius, and between and after the Stems, he enjoyed? an unbroken series of notable releases and outfits. The discography is vast, not least of all because Richard Lane insisted that bands should record, and records should be released, even if he had to run a label himself.?Across social media, a unique and quite glorious history? has emerged of a truly cool human being, who had everything to give, and gave it all, every day. If the game is to do a million different things for a million different people, and not look for thanks or recognition, then Richard Lane is up there with the greats.If your icecream fell on the floor, he would buy you another. If you had a song, Richard heard it.? If your guitar was broke, Richard fixed it. If you were in trouble, Richard called you. If you were coming down to the show, you were on the door. If you wanted to learn, Richard taught you, and made you see that you knew something to begin with. If you had a cause, Richard would listen, and, if your cause was cool, he showed up for the fight.But chivalry is just the tip of the iceberg. Richard followed up, he maintained relationships, he supported communities and he brought you into them. He encouraged you, he saw your worth and marvelled at it, and his blue eyes constantly twinkled with love for one and all.Family Aspirations for the CommunityWe are getting to know what we lost and what remains... and what remains are the dearest things to the heart of the man.? Always a great family person, for many years now Richard has been dedicated to his partner Cathy and his daughter Penny (aged 11).? Together they opened and built Penny Lane's Music Workshop?More than a family-run music school, Penny Lane's is a community institution, where young people and older people learn that music is in them and how they might express it; a place where melody is celebrated? for its magic, and where it is honed and gifted to the wider community with the utmost love and generosity.?It is called Penny Lane's because it is inspired by Penny and the wonder and joy children know in music. It belongs to Penny and it is guided by her. Penny Lane's remains and must be saved.Call for DonationsThe COVID restrictions have greatly disrupted Penny Lane's music making mission, with students being unable to participate in face-to-face lessons or other school events. Other services offered by Penny Lane's, such as the sale of entry-level instruments, have been severely affected by the downturn. Penny Lane's, like so many businesses, has been battling extreme financial pressures over this period. Another enterprise, Gratias Organics, was forced into immediate hibernation due to the sudden prohibition on pop-up kitchens.Before these events, Penny Lane's was substantially dependent on the forty or more lessons that Richard delivered each week. This place of music now needs to evolve over the coming months to succeed without his contribution. Richard's family needs your help to keep afloat over this period and pay the bills in order to start the next chapter.?Penny and Cathy are strong women who are dealing with tragic loss. They have support from family, community and friends. We are asking that the wider music community and all people who have been touched by Richard Lane and his work, now dig deep and kick in to assist them in these dire circumstances. Your messages of support and love posted here or at the remembrance space at Penny Lane's are highly valued as well.?Guaranteed that you will look up one night and see two blueish stars twinkling at you in appreciation.**This fundraiser is run by me, Josh Reynolds, for the exclusive benefit of Cathy Ann Gavranich (partner of Richard) and Penny (their daughter).

Because of the fact that my mom spent the years before her symptoms raising four kids and going back to school for Social Work (graduating a year before her symptoms became debilitating),? she did not earn enough? work credits and therefore does not qualify for disability assistance. She is still ten years away from being eligible for Medicare. This means that full-time home care, assistive technology, and home modifications have been and will continue to be out of pocket expenses for my family.??Currently, we have no way to transport my mom outside of the house in her power chair due to its weight. Our hope is to get my mom an accessible van so that she can participate in and enjoy the things she used to do, such as visiting friends and family, going to church, going up to Lake Michigan, volunteering at hospice, riffing through produce at the grocery store, and going on walks through the MetroParks.??The total cost of a used, accessible van is between 40-45k. This includes the price of the van and around 20-25k in added conversions cost to make it handicap accessible. We are hoping to offset the conversion part of this purchase through the contributions we might raise. This is why we have chosen 25k as our target amount. We plan on closing this fundraiser at the end of August.?To give clarity on our situation, my family is focusing their financial resources on modifying our house to include a first floor accessible bedroom and bathroom, so that my mom can stay at home. With this, in addition to upcoming care expenses and other adaptations, we are experiencing financial strain and would like to minimize any additional borrowing that we can.?It is difficult to ask for help. I know that many of us are under financial strain due to COVID-19, and there are so many organizations to donate to that are fighting for racial and economic justice in our current moment. It is easy to feel like there is not enough, but we believe that orienting ourselves toward abundance, community, and generosity brings about the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth for all of us.?If you cannot help financially, there are so many other ways to bless my mom during this time! Spiritual nourishment through phone calls, visits, mail, and prayer all bring joy to my mom.?Thank you for taking the time to read this.

On August 1st 2018, the lives of the Rodriguez family were drastically turned upside down with the sudden and abrupt discovery that Isaac had a large tumor and multiple other tumors in his brain. Right before this revelation, he was at an eye exam where the optometrist said he needed an immediate CT scan because his optical nerves were very swollen-which meant swelling or mass of the brain. His parents rushed him to Vidant Medical in Greenville NC. Moments after the scan, the ER doctor came in and said ?úYour son has a large tumor on his brainstem and needs immediate surgery.??The following morning, he had his first surgery. An EVD was placed through his skull, into his ventricles allowing the pressure and extra fluid to drain. The next day, after a 9 hour surgery where the surgeon removed the largest tumor, they heard the words that no parent ever wants to hear. -It?ôs cancer. ? ?? On August 26th, Isaac made the 14 and half hour drive to St. Jude. His treatment plan was to receive 30 rounds of high dose radiation and 7 months of chemotherapy (3 of those being a new trial) for medulloblastoma. Just two days after arriving, Isaac developed a small rash. By the next day, the rash had spread, and started to blister. Isaac was diagnosed with Steven Johnson Syndrome after many labs came back negative. This is a severe, and rare disorder of the skin and mucous membranes caused by an allergic reaction to medication. Steven Johnson Syndrome causes the body to burn from the inside, out. He was allergic to his anti seizure medication. Just two days later, his entire body was covered with blisters and open lesions. The ICU team at St. Jude knew that he needed life saving skin treatments that they could not provide. He was life flighted to Cincinnati Children?ôs Hospital in Ohio where he spent almost three weeks in the Intensive Care Unit. The Steven Johnson Syndrome eventually consumed 100% of his body. He was then transferred to the Shriners Burn Center Hospital, also in Cincinnati. He had multiple surgeries receiving skin graphs that covered more that half of his body, and a feeding tube. He lost all ability to eat or drink and walk. The doctors were not optimistic of his survival. His parents were told to prepare themselves and their children that he would probably not make it. If by slight chance he did survive, they said he would be blind, deaf, unable to walk or talk, and have severe scarring all over his body. On September 19, the doctor came in and said ?úIn all my years of treating patients with Steven Johnson, I?ôve never seen a case as severe as Isaac?ôs.??In the same breath, he also said that he?ôs never seen anyone ever recover as quickly as Isaac. Jesse and Lynette looked at him and said, this is the the power of prayer. Through it all, he still smiled through the immense pain he was in. This alone shows how much life and love this child holds within. Steven Johnson Syndrome is absolutely one of the most painful things that can happen to a person.? ? ? Just when they thought that they were given the worst news, sadly, there is yet another hurdle for sweet Isaac. The chemotherapy has caused major damage to his bone marrow. He is now being referred to the hematology, and bone marrow failure team at St. Jude. There are still many unknowns as to where they go from here. All we know at this time, is that he will have a bone marrow biopsy and a skin biopsy to see if the damage is permanent, or if the chemo has caused mutations to the marrow that will require a different route for treating and helping renew the marrow to start working properly.We need your help!Isaac's cancer is maintaining its size and is not getting any bigger at this time, however Doctors and physicians have stopped all treatment. They have told the Rodriguez family that if his cancer grows or transitions into another area of his body their isn't anything that can be done due to Isaac's rare condition.? ?? So all that being said Isaac was introduced to the Make a Wish foundation. His wish was to have a pontoon boat for him and his family to all be able to enjoy fishing, even if he has to eventually use a wheelchair, he can still go.? Well unfortunately The Make a Wish foundation rejected his request because in this region they will not provide a boat with an engine larger than a 25hp. They also tried to get just a Pontoon boat without an engine but they wouldn't do that either. This got me to thinking why cant we all pitch in and make this happen! We sincerely need your help to make Isaac's wish happen! Any amount will help! Your donation will go directly to that cause and nothing else! Thank you~ Please help Isaac's wish come true with us...? No amount is too small. If you are unable to help financially, please keep this sweet boy, his doctors, and his family in your thoughts and prayers. Thank you so much for being a part of his story. He, and all of us, are so incredibly thankful for everyone he has met, and everyone that has reached out while he has been fighting the biggest and most important fight of his life.

We see the atrocities committed at the hands of the police and we understand that the country we live in today was built on the oppression of Black Americans. We have seen Tatte?ôs supposed stance on Instagram as a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement but unfortunately, we have yet to see tangible actions made by the corporation.?During our time at Tatte, we have all learned the story of its founding and internalized the values the company defines itself by. ""Our mission,"" you claim, ""is to inspire, care for and touch every person, neighborhood, and city with our experience through our food, our passion, and our culture."" We believe that it is impossible to care for our community?îwithin Boston and beyond?îwithout acknowledging the horrors Black Americans have faced within the United States and making a clear commitment to using your privilege and financial resources to support organizations that work for justice.

More often than not she could be found outside practising her gymnastics or dancing to Justin Bieber songs. She is also my niece.?Lilly was taken to A&E at East Surrey Hospital on 09/08/2020 after having difficulty swallowing her food, dribbling, talking and maintaining her balance. The following day Lilly was transferred to the neuroscience paediatrics ward at St. George?ôs Hospital in Tooting, where on 12/08/2020 she was diagnosed with a rare and highly aggressive tumour in her brain stem (Diffuse Midline Glioma / DIPG). We have been advised that patients with this type of tumour have an average life expectancy of 8 months from diagnosis. We are all devastated by this news and are still struggling to take it all in - it has all happened so fast.Currently, Lilly is able to talk (with some impediments) and walk, however she does have problems with her balance and coordination meaning sometimes she does wobble and fall over. For a previously very energetic child, she also tires quickly now. She is majoritively tube fed through a nasogastric tube with some soft, pureed foods to help improve her ability to swallow - throughout everything she has been put through, this is what frustrates Lilly the most at the moment as she is desperate for pasta, strawberries, and doughnuts! We hope treatment will help relieve some of her symptoms however we are fully aware she will decline fairly rapidly once the effects of the treatment have subsided.Due to the critical location of the tumour and its nature, Lilly's treatment options are very limited; she will receive 2.5 weeks (13 days) of daily radiotherapy treatment at The Royal Marsden to alleviate some of her symptoms; beyond that will be palliative care. Clinical trials may have been an option however due to COVID-19 these trials are not available in the UK currently and would require a biopsy which could potentially cause additional trauma to Lilly's brain, so it was decided not to pursue this option and instead focus on making her happy and comfortable.We are aiming to raise funds so Lilly can make memories with her family and friends. As everything has happened so quickly, we haven't been able to pinpoint any particular ideas at this moment in time, but the main aim is to make her remaining time as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. We are also not able to predict what activities Lilly will be able to do as her health continues to decline and COVID-19 related travel and social distancing restrictions will also make planning activities more challenging. If we are unable to use some or all of the funds raised to make memories for Lilly, it is intended the funds will be used for funeral costs and also donations to charities and organisations that have supported Lilly, such as The Royal Marsden Trust and Children with Cancer UK.Further information in relation to Lilly's type of brain tumour is available here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The repeated abuse defendant endured cannot be compartmentalized or separated from her actions on the night of the crime. They are inextricably interlinked...What we have learned in the two decades since the defendant's sentencing is that domestic violence should be viewed by our criminal justice system in a manner that recognizes not only their status as offenders but their status as survivors.?ùIt is under this umbrella that I am asking the community to help support?

The small cohort will study scripture, theology, apologetics and christian ministry.? We will be unpacking the big questions of our generation in Oxford?ôs ancient halls.? For far too long the realm of the spirit has gone unsung in the academy, and Theologos is seeking to remedy this.Most notably, in residence is the authoritative theologian NT Wright; a foremost authority on the Apostle Paul and a personal hero of mine.? His making himself available by meeting with Theologos weekly is a massive privilege.? If he is unknown to you, imagine discussing your reading over lunch with a modern day CS Lewis.? He?ôs a very big deal! Wycliffe Hall has assembled a diverse group for the program.? I personally have spent the last 7 years at Bethel where I completed three years of the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry and was discipled for 4 years in the realm of spiritual intelligence. I have focused on developing my gift of discerning of spirits and honing a strong awareness of atmospheres, relational dynamics and Heaven?ôs blueprints over humans and cities.? I am honored to now take that experience into the scholastic halls of the academy!Where this will lead, I don?ôt know ?îbut I am no stranger to Oxford.? Heaven likes this place.? I worked for St Aldates, the Anglican church in the heart of Oxford from 2012 -2013, and have returned often since to build relationships with residents and minister to the city.? In its streets I feel the massive creative potential and powerful authority the inhabitants are tapping into.? Simon Ponsonby, a pastor of theology at St Aldates, explained to me that it was actually the plan of Adolf Hitler to rule the Third Reich from Oxford.? Remarkably, the city, while beautiful and ancient, is not the prettiest of Europe, nor the most strategically situated.? Hitler?ôs plans only make sense to those who look in the spirit.? This city, known for its intellectuals, is a seat of power.? World leaders spend formative years in Oxford and many influential hearts and minds pass through it.? It is a sobering privilege to worship amongst them, learn with them, and to pray for them.? It is humbling and exciting to take part in a story so much bigger than me!My flight is booked.? My room secured.? I even have all of my books for the course! BUT like every great story a test has presented itself, my hurtle to overcome:? I was denied the loan to cover my tuition.?I was genuinely surprised.? I had a little cry, indulged a brief panic, and then asked a host of friends what the Lord was saying. I didn't tell them what the problem was, just asked for the solution.Without even knowing the situation, the overwhelming response to their prayers was that I was to go.? To jump, to buckle up, to launch, to trust and watch Him make it happen.? And so that's where you find me: following Jesus into the unknown. Here's the situation: I have less than a week to raise $25,000 to apply for my visa.?The deadline is this Friday, August 14.I know.?

It has called to my mind, the fact that for many people around the world and in my own circle, suffering is not new. ? In times like these, looking to people who have persevered through hardship helps to give perspective and reminds me to be grateful.My friend, Victoria and her family have been a particular source of inspiration and blessing. ? She has experienced first hand the uncertainties of life. Whenever I think of her, I think of strength and faith and perseverance.?I?ôd like to share her story with you and give you an opportunity to bless her.This is a picture of ?Victoria and her oldest son, Joshua.?She and her husband, Jerry, ?and son, Joshua, came to the US as a refugee in 2002.?Prior to coming to the US she lived in Liberia, a country in West Africa. She and Jerry ?had married in 1982 and had a beautiful little girl, Jerrylee a year later. A few years later they had a son, Ambrose.? Jerry worked in the Liberian government, but unexpectedly the country was overtaken by an oppressive regime and she and her family were forced to leave the country in 1990. They fled to safety, just north to Sierra Leone and lived there in a refugee camp for 5 years.?Living in a refugee camp is incredibly challenging but they started attending a Baptist church in the camp and their new faith and trust in God changed everything for her and gave her hope. She would need God?ôs comfort, ?for at the age of 13, her daughter Jerylee, came down with an eye infection that they discovered to be cancer. She died shortly after. Her son Ambrose also became ill. He contracted yellow fever and died at the age of 10. She was pregnant at the time and soon after her daughter Benppe was born. She and Jerry had hoped to find a better life, but Liberia was still unsafe. They were told they should go to a different refugee camp in Guinea, a nearby country in West Africa.? In 1997,? they arrived there with Benetta and their new son, Joshua, and started on the process of trying to get a new home in the US, but all of this moved slow. When Benetta was 5 she came down with a high temperature and they took her to the hospital. She was very sick. The hospital gave her some medicine, but for some reason, unknown, it caused her death. Victoria was very despondent and she says she went crying into a field, declaring that God must have surely abandoned her. She had lost her home and three of her children to death. Her pastor followed her and shared with her the story of Job and how his suffering had led him to doubt God but ultimately He came to fully trust and see the sovereign plan of God. She went home and read the book of Job and it set her feet on a firm course. In 2002 she arrived in the US with Jerry, Joshua and three of her brothers children who were left in Victoria?ôs care. My mom met Victoria and Jerry at church and we have been family friends for many years. They inspire us with their work ethic and their joy. In spite of not having a car, Victoria takes the bus to two jobs. She works many hours. She doesn?ôt complain. Since being in the US they have had another son, David, who is now 16. Because he is autistic, Jerry is his caregiver. Joshua earned a full scholarship at ASU and will graduate this next May. He is a great son who aspires to a good career. I love talking to him. When Covid started, I asked a group of friends to help me gather some supplies for Victoria?ôs family since she has limited shopping time and doesn?ôt have transportation. They were so generous. When I dropped them off to Victoria, she asked me if I would help her get a house. I couldn?ôt say anything but yes, because how could God not want to bless this woman and her family with a house. So Jim said, ??we are in a bubble of rich, blessed, generous, people of faith filled friends so we will just ask them to help.??So friends, can you join in helping to get Victoria a house? It?ôs been an interesting adventure working on this and seeing how difficult it is to navigate and also the generosity of our government and local companies. The ?city of phoenix has a program called ?úSection 32??homes. Google it. Anyway they help families this size? with an income of 36k find affordable housing. Nevertheless, the home still costs 200K. If Victoria can make a sizable down payment her mortgage becomes doable. She currently pays 900 a month by working two jobs. My realtor friend with a heart of gold, Dana Hubbell is helping Victoria by donating her commission and working out the real estate process. We are finishing up with the application process and praying that God will bless this venture. If you would like to join in blessing this family, please donate here!?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My wife is going through a very difficult immigration process (click on above links to read the details) though she has lived in the U.S. since she was an infant. She was raised as an American and believed herself to be a citizen until she was 22 years old. She's a wonderful woman. Any country would be happy to have people like her. Though America doesn't recognize her right now, I believe it someday will. I believe my wife will get to call America ""home"" again without reservation.?We have been working diligently for 5 years now, doing everything within our power to obtain legal status for my wife. It's been a long and difficult journey with a series of small heartbreaks along the way. I want my wife to live in this country, her country, without fear of being detained and/or deported to a country she knows nothing about.?Last year, I hired a great immigration lawyer. With great legal help comes great financial responsibilities. I'm afraid that with the direction this case is taking, we may be in over our heads financially. If we do go to federal court (and it looks like we will), it will likely cost a lot of money in legal fees. I was quoted $25k to 40k in legal fees by a different attorney last year in order to take my wife's case to court - hence the large goal amount on this fundraiser.I ask you to partner with us in this whether it's financially, prayerfully, or writing letters to your Congressional Representatives in support of private bills S. 3490 - A bill for the relief of Rebecca Trimble (in the Senate) and H.R. 7807 - For the relief of Rebecca Trimble (in the House). These must be approved in both parts of Congress and then be signed by the President to become a private law granting Becky permanent residency.If you would like a template support letter, I have two examples that may be helpful. If enough Senators and Representatives start hearing about Rebecca's case, it can make a huge difference. Make a comment if you would like the example letters and I? can send them via email.I came across this Bible passage awhile back and it struck a chord in my heart because of our situation. It's provided a lot of encouragement to me during difficult times...""Trust in the Lord and do good. Then you will live safely in the land and prosper. Take delight in the Lord , and he will give you your heart?ôs desires. Commit everything you do to the Lord . Trust him, and he will help you. He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn, and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.""Psalms 37:3???? NLTWith gratitude and clinging to His promises,John",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tra qualche giorno terminato l?ôultimo ciclo di chemioterapia sapr√≤, dalla bocca di alcuni medici, oncologo e gastroenterologi, come e quanto ancora lungo sar? questo mio andare, previsioni e non certezze, quelle sono questioni che non appartengono a nessuno di noi. Questo √® il peggior periodo per prendere una decisione del genere, ma √® anche vero che √® arrivato il momento perch√© io sono malato dal 2013 ed il tempo assume un?ôimportanza che non pu√≤ essere sottovalutata. Vi ho sempre raccontato della difficolt? di fare progetti nelle mie condizioni, ma i momenti che stiamo vivendo tutti ed i silenzi con cui mi sto confrontando, mi hanno dato coraggio e anche fiducia ad aver speranza.Da settembre del 2018 ai primi giorni di marzo di quest?ôanno ho partecipato a numerosi incontri, per mia scelta a titolo gratuito, che si sono andati oltre la mera presentazione di un libro, ho raccontato quella parte della mia vita che sto vivendo con il cancro al pancreas, percependo man mano e realmente l?ôimportanza di ci√≤ che stavo facendo. Non ho interrotto anche con questo nuovo anno e la ripresa della terapia salvavita. Poi l?ôarrivo della pandemia, il virus che pu√≤ essere vinto solo cambiando le nostre abitudini e con un isolamento che non giova di certo all?ôessere umano per la sua crescita. Ho sempre considerato che questo mio andare ed il condividere con altri una situazione non facile da descrivere, come un dare maggior significato alla mia vita e a questo passaggio. Perch√© √® cos√¨ che siamo tutti, di passaggio. Vorrei poter tornare nei posti dove sono gi? stato a piedi, desidererei girare maggiormente il nostro bel Paese e incontrare le persone, perch√© √® nell?ôincontro verso l?ôaltro che si concretizza l?ôessenza stessa della viandanza ed adesso tutto non √® pi√π possibile ma torner? ad esserlo.Ho iniziato a camminare perch√© mi faceva star bene e con un passo avanti l?ôaltro, il mio cammino √® diventato quello di tantissime altre persone, malate e non. Ho iniziato a scrivere e raccontarmi in modo terapeutico per non tenermi tutto dentro e con ?úSe cammino vivo??ho ricevuto il grazie da parte di migliaia di persone, penso che sia il pi√π grande complimento per aver scritto un libro. ?Nel diario che puntualmente metto a disposizione delle persone che incontro c?ô√?luce e a dirlo non sono stato di certo io, le frasi scritte ed i pensieri riportati sono di pura bellezza.Tantissime sono state le volte che donne e uomini mi hanno chiesto di mia moglie, che identifico sempre nella reale forza che mi d? il coraggio ad andare avanti, durante le chiacchierate per parlare del libro √® uscita quasi sempre la domanda ¬´ma tua moglie?¬ª.? da qualche tempo che con Sally abbiamo preso alcune decisioni importanti, non avendo figli √® tutto molto pi√π semplice anche se non facile. Questo mio vivere da ?úsopravvivente?? una casa troppo grande e difficile oramai da gestire, le tante problematiche risolvibili che fanno di contorno alla nostra vita, ma che sono diventate difficili da sostenere, sono diventate situazioni che ci hanno suggerito l?ôimportanza di provare a continuare a vivere solo con l?ôessenziale. Poi sono arrivate queste terribili giornate di pandemia, interminabili ore, dove ci siamo trovati nella situazione meno adatta per poter affrontare una situazione gi? difficile e complicata. Posso rischiare di morire e non averla accanto, a causa delle restrizioni e della mia malattia, tutto questo mi ha fatto prendere la decisione. Per il tempo che resta, la vorr√≤ avere sempre con me. Ci√≤ che sta accadendo e le riflessioni raccolte durante gli incontri con persone sconosciute mi hanno fatto venire in mente che un desiderio si pu√≤ ancora una volta allargare ad un qualcosa di pi√π grande, ad un progetto.Il mio cammino √® iniziato da una posizione orizzontale di un letto di ospedale ed √® continuato un passo avanti l?ôaltro, come la voglia di vivere che √® cominciata ovviamente in maniera egoistica per poi trasformarsi in amore verso gli altri, sono convinto che la realizzazione di questo ?úprogetto??possa solo aprire delle porte molto pi√π grandi. Anche se non riesco, perch√© non mi √® possibile di quantificarne la durata, a nessuno √® concesso, sono convinto che posso anche in questo modo aiutare delle persone, chiedendo aiuto per la prima volta io stesso. Mi sono sempre riempito la bocca di parole come essenziale, consapevolezza, superfluo. ? arrivato il momento di condividere totalmente la nostra vita con gli altri. Se me ne sar? data la possibilit? sar? un continuare a sensibilizzare su una malattia poco conosciuta, come il cancro del pancreas, continuando a parlarne, perch√© a mio modesto parere √® un?ôottima forma di prevenzione. Io non ho avuto questa fortuna.Lo far√≤ in itinere con mia moglie e con il camper ?úTano il gabbiano?? chiamatelo amore, perch√© √® di questo che sto pensando e scrivendo. Posso solo garantirvi che nonostante il cancro inoperabile e la patologia grave che mi accompagna, non avr√≤ pensato solo a me stesso, in fondo non l?ôho mai fatto e questo forse √® veramente il motivo per cui mi √® stata concessa gi? una seconda possibilit? e se me ne sar? data ancora una, perch√© posso assicurarvi che quella avuta √® gi? scaduta, lo si potr? notare. ?úTano??come il gabbiano che mi ha accompagnato lungo il mio peregrinare, l?ôho conosciuto il 20 ottobre del 2018 quando, a pochi giorni dai cinque anni con la malattia, ero in cammino in Portogallo. Nome non di certo originale per un gabbiano, ma io ho fatto finta da quel giorno che sia sempre lo stesso, che sia sempre lui a venirmi a trovare, per parlare di libert? e di speranza. Ogni giorno si presentava, veniva portato dalle onde dell?ôoceano e mi ha accompagnato in passi non certo facili. Con la sua semplicit? poi si allontanava per tornare verso il cuore dell?ôoceano, lasciandomi non solo con i miei pensieri, ma con un qualcosa di immenso come la speranza.Questo √® il nome che daremo alla nostra nuova ?úcasa?? a questo desiderio. ?úTano il gabbiano?? il nome che daremo al camper con cui gironzoleremo per l?ôItalia, per incontrare persone e parlare, per cercare la luce dove c?ô√?il buio, per vedere positivo dove tutto pu√≤ sembrare negativo. Per tornare in citt? gi? toccate lungo i sentieri percorsi a piedi e in terre e luoghi mai visitati.In un recente incontro a Livorno, persone che non conosco e ci√≤ mi ha dato molto da pensare e non in maniera negativa, si sono offerte di aiutarmi in questa idea, ho ceduto e messo da parte il mio orgoglio ed ho deciso di buon cuore di accettare il loro aiuto che si potr? unire al vostro. Non so perch√© tutto √® nato in questa citt? che ha visto le tracce dei miei passi, solo perch√© dalla montagna ho voluto vedere il mare, per poi tornare verso la montagna, ma se tutto deve avere un proseguimento ripartendo da questa terra, cos√¨ sia. Durante l?ôincontro avuto il 3 marzo, tra le tantissime persone presenti, e le molte dimostrazioni di affetto, un uomo di cui non conosco il nome, mi si √® avvicinato, con una copia del mio libro in mano, non lo ha acquistato, ma ha fatto molto di pi√π e mi ha detto, ¬´sono contento, √® un piacere ogni tanto incontrare un vivente¬ª, ti ringrazio, mi hanno detto che una volta eri un prete, non lo so, non ho approfondito, non ho voluto farlo, non giudico, non posso farlo, ma scrivo che ti ringrazio, per molti sembri un ?úuomo di strada?? secondo me pi√π semplicemente sei una persona che ama stare con gli ultimi, tra gli ultimi e a me hai fatto riflettere e ti ho osservato sin dall?ôinizio, il tuo bicchiere di vino rosso, il tuo ?úaddormentarti??per poi riprenderti, una delle onde si √® infranta su di me che parlavo di una tempesta, anche se non √® la stessa.Dopo questa lunga premessa, chiudo la parentesi aperta e lascio a voi continuare, fiducioso di poter ancora raccontare di questi passi. Se il momento non √® quello giusto, √® arrivato lo stesso, se per adesso dobbiamo restare in casa, domani spero di riabbracciarvi tutti, perch√© ne ho di bisogno, perch√© tutti ne abbiamo di bisogno.

I'm an Accidental American.If you know me you may know that I was born in America. Me and my (British) mother left the states when I was but 7 months old and have never returned.Fast forward 28 years later. I now live and work in Sweden. Not too long ago my Swedish bank informed me that I should look into my tax obligations in America, since it states on my identity that I was born there.?""Tax? In America? How?"" Thought I. ""I've never lived or worked there, how can I owe them tax?"" How very foolish I was. Little did I know that the USA have some wacky law that states that all citizens are obligated to file and pay taxes (well of course, makes sense)...regardless of whether they actually live or work in the country (OK, less sense being made...).Here is a link which explains my situation in more detail:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_AmericanMy mother had me registered as a British citizen when I was born and in all the stress of leaving my father and moving back to the UK, did not realise how my American citizenship would affect my tax obligations when I became an adult, obligations which include me filing and paying taxes every year since I turned 18, which I of course have not done. This means that if I went to 'Merica today ?they'd lock me right up in prison for Tax Evasion. Now, as rock and roll as that sounds, it's not exactly what I'd had planned.So, the new plan:I have a lawyer. He is helping me. He will file my taxes and explain my situation to the American tax agency. In order for this to take less time, effort and money (and stop me having to file every year for the rest of my life) he recommends that I renounce my American citizenship.Additionally, I currently have a residence permit here in Sweden on the grounds that I am a European citizen. That is on its way to not being the case soon thanks to a lovely little thing called Brexit.?In order to apply for Swedish citizenship and stay here long term I need to renounce one of my other two citizenships (British or American).Considering my past, my situation and my accent, I'm keeping the British one and have decided to say goodbye to the 'Land of the Free' (ahem...).Here's where it gets super fun - according to my lawyer the entire process of renouncing my citizenship, filing 10 years worth of taxes and proving that I didn't evade them on purpose will cost me the friendly neighborhood sum of around 5000USD (around 50.000 Swedish crowns). Yup.2500USD = Renouncement application and fee3000USD = Tax filing and legal fees.Y'all, I work in the arts. That kind of money does not come easy.So I've decided to ask for help - not for the whole amount, I feel that would be a little cheeky since I still feel responsible for my own situation. I'm asking for a buffer while I spend the next year saving my butt off.?Any small amount would incur my eternal gratitude and debt. I know times are hard and money is tight everywhere but until they decide to finally tax those 6 billionaires that are ruining the world, we're still going to have to rely on others to help us out in a pinch.So this is me, in a pinch, asking for help.?Thank you for reading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1566,Martha's Daughter,"Created August 7, 2020","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","$21,525 ","$300,00",320,868,320,"Greetings,My name is Nyanyika Banda. I am a chef, writer and entrepreneur. Today I am inviting you to join me in investing in an exciting and important business venture.? The foundation of this project? began 70 years ago, when my great grandmother, Marie Elliott,? purchased a home and surrounding property on the Upper Cape in Massachusetts, and ran it as a lodging home and bed and breakfast called Wagon Wheel. At the time, my family were the only Blacks to own land in the area. To this day, they still are.?For the past 20 years I have worked in the restaurant and hospitality industry. My first job was at a small family owned restaurant when I was 15 years old, where I prepped vegetables and cleaned tables. I fell into curiosity with recipes and then I fell in love with cooking.? For the last two decades I have traveled the world working as a chef and entrepreneur. As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin I started an underground pop up restaurant, serving in bars, breweries and distilleries and developing a huge following.? Upon graduating I was opening the brick and mortar version of that pop up, which in 2018 won an EATER Award for BEST ROADTRIP RESTAURANT.? feel strongly connected to my great grandmother in the sense of wanting to create spaces where people feel welcomed and that they can be their true selves, while also receiving quality food and service. Martha's Daughter, will be another destination spot.?By reviving the idea of a Bed and Breakfast, similar to what my great grandmother ran half a century ago, we can provide travelers with not only a boutique hotel experience but also a chance to stay on a historical landmark, a piece of property that was purchased by an ambitious, middle aged Black Woman 70 years ago and is still in the hands of her descendants.?Unfortunately, we are living in a world similar to the one my Gram lived in. 70 years ago, it was not safe everywhere to be Black in America. And we are currently living in a climate where it is again (or still) not safe everywhere to be Black in America. My Gram worked hard her entire life to make sure the racist whites would not take that land away from her. The very least I can do is to fight for it.?The purpose of this GoFundMe is to raise money to purchase a portion of this original property and the existing home to renovate into Martha?ôs Daughter on the Cape. Before she passed, Mrs. Elliott divided her property and divided it among her children. We fortunately have living relatives residing in most of the homes. This past spring my great aunt, and the eldest of Marie?ôs children passed away. This home is currently for sale and the hope is to purchase this property to keep it in the family and to continue this wonderful family legacy. Photo of the original Wagon Wheel on the Elliott EstastesThe Negro Motorist Greenbook was a guidebook for Black American roadtrippers that wa s published during the Jim Crow Era. It was created and published by a Black NYC mailman named Victor Hugo Green from 1936 - 1966. During Jim Crow Black travelers were constantly at risk of being refused service at gas stations, restaurants and hotels. And even worse threats and physical violence. Green founded the guidebook by compiling resources ?úto give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable.?ùThe Wagon Wheel was included in the Greenbook. As the way my cousins tell it to me, it was a place for notable Black politicians, artists,writers and musicians passed through because there were no other options on that part of the Cape.?My cousin, who is the same age as my mother, Martha, told me this story. On a summer day in the late 1960?ôs she sat on the front porch of the big Victorian house with my great grandmother, or ?úGram??as we all refer to her. A view of the Cape Cod Canal sits across the vast green yard that is spotted with Locust trees. While they were enjoying their time together, a car pulled up the horseshoe driveway. A white man got out. He looked at Gram and my cousin and aggressively said to them,? ?úSomeday, we?ôre gonna take this back from you.?ùMy Gram sat up in her chair, and leaned forward, she took her glasses off and made her eyes real big,? ?úNOT while my eyes are still open!??She informed the white man. He got in his car and drove away.?In 1950, my Gram, a Black female mother and entrepreneur from Cambridge, Massachusetts,? purchased the house and the surrounding almost six acres. She became the first and only Black person to own land in the area. She turned the home into The Wagon Wheel Bed and Breakfast? and named the property The Elliott Estates.?Photo of me, my younger sister and Gram in the big house.?Martha?ôs Daughter will be a full service, upscale, Bed & Breakfast. There is a combination of suites and individual rooms throughout the house to accommodate families, couples and singles. The entire home will be available for rental for wedding parties and special events.? Multiple rooms have their own private entrance and bathrooms.?Guests will also be able to enjoy the backyard, where there is a koi pond, vegetable garden, and meditation trails. There are two common areas with fireplaces.?Included in the stay will be a continental breakfast with fresh juices and coffee and an a la carte menu for purchase.? All menus will be designed by Executive Chef Banda and will feature local ingredients, including vegetables and herbs from the B&B garden. ?There will be an option for guests to purchase picnic basket lunches to take to the beach or sack lunches to take on the bike trails.?A Martha?ôs Daughter Food Truck will be available for rental for weddings and specials events. It will also function as a local summer food attraction.?Future location of Martha's Daughter Bed & Breakfast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1569,FASHION TRANSFORMATION FUND,"Created September 12, 2020","Dreams, Hopes & Wishes","$21,263 ","$50,000 ",588,8,543,"Dear Reader, Hello I?ôm Fashion. I?ôm a trans woman living in NYC. I?ôm having a series of upcoming gender affirming surgeries, and I?ôm looking for assistance with the associated costs when I am unable to use my body to work. I?ôm a survival sex worker who actually isn?ôt so psychologically apt for that kind of work (for a myriad of reasons.) & I have no safety net or familial support. I have been transitioning for 9 years on my own which often has averted me from accessing resources and opportunities to better my life. For example, I was unable to attend college for years because I was a ?údependent??student who wasn?ôt supported by my parents as a person. The only way as a teenager I could access health insurance in order to have? hormones was if I remained in the books of literal poverty. If I made over a certain amount of money I would disqualify from the insurance. In retrospect hormones obviously were a necessity that improved my mental health, my capability doing sex work, and my ability to make more money. I had ?únormal jobs??where I experienced rampant transphobic discrimination, sexual harassment, racism, and many more things that damaged my self worth. I was scarred from that kind of work. There was no guidance, no healthy coping mechanisms, and no clear framework for how I was to navigate survival that I understood or could access as a naive, transient, transgender youth.Recently, I have had a string of traumatic experiences that have pushed me to seek out these surgeries to ensure my safety/ mental health/ survival. I want to further align my body with my self-idealized gender presentation and mitigate more of my deeply inhibiting gender dysphoria. Being trans is extremely expensive and often inaccessible. This is why I?ôm asking for help. I know that by prioritizing my own needs I will be able to continue to help uplift and elevate many other people around me. I am concerned with building community, supporting other people like me with less privilege, access, and mobility. I want to liberate others from the confines of their minds and the social constructs that hold us hostage to systems of constraint and oppression. I want to continue to honor the legacy of those who have paved the way for girls like me, and continue to pave the way for those to come. However, I will admit it is actually very difficult to do so when I sometimes am unable to help myself! I chose the latest iteration of my name -Fashion- not to commemorate the materiality of clothing, or the legacy of exclusivity/ exclusion of a highly decadent and capitalistic world, but because the verb/ active form of Fashion means ?úto style?? Although life is difficult and trying, I hope to style a better future for myself and continue to contribute to the fashioning of our global consciousness.Thank you so much for reading and if you decide to help me in any form- monetarily, socially, spiritually, energetically. I appreciate sincerity periodXXMuch love,Fashion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
